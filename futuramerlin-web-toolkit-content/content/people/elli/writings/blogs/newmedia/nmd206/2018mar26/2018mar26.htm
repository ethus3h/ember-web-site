This isn't done yet, but here's a pretty screenshot of some code:

And here is a screenshot of an actual page generated by the code:

So far, it works with the simple test suite I've made, but fails mysteriously when applied to real data. It needs debugging. Also, it does not yet implement the visual release pages. The approach of the project is using shell scripts that would process textual data files to produce HTML pages, so that the data can be maintained easily using a text editor without having to maintain the HTML pages by hand.

Audience: The audience for this tool would be musicians, and later other types of artist, who want a Web portfolio.

Budget: I estimate this will take about 50 to 100 hours for remaining programming.
