====== HON170 article summary and analysis: # 3: Income inequality ======

Article: "The American right focuses on poverty, not inequality, to avoid blame". Robert B Reich. //The Observer//. 22 February 2014. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/23/american-right-inequality-robert-reich-obama


===== Summary =====

In this article, former labor secretary of the United States Robert Reich argues that American conservatives focus economic discussion on reducing poverty, rather than economic inequality, so it will not be considered that their ways must be changed to implement a more egalitarian economic reality. He argues that the rapidly shrinking middle class reduces opportunities for upward economic mobility, and that the current economic imbalance leaves the lower classes financially trapped, less able to get the jobs they would need at the wages they would need to become part of the middle and upper classes.

===== Analysis =====

While Reich makes some good points in his article, he neglects to take into account the effects of high tax rates on the poor. Massive government spending on military expansion and welfare services points to inefficiency in the financial management of taxpayer dollars. This arguably has as much an effect on the lower classes as excessive wealth in the hands of the wealthy. I think that an effective solution would need to strike simultaneously at these weaknesses, reducing government spending to only the most critical and fiscally efficient services, both at a federal and state level, and pruning inefficient spending in the services that remain. For example, the public K-12 education system in Maine is massively inefficient, spending money on computers for students. While proponents of the program say this will increase technological literacy for students, what worth does such knowledge have when a student is unable to research effectively using books? Rather, it serves to distract students in the classroom, with the computers being used to read the //Face Book// Web site instead of study academics, and to create massive support costs for schools that must hire workers to constantly monitor students' use of these computers â€” costs that are directly passed on to the lower classes in tax dollars.
