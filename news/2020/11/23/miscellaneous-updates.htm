<h1>Miscellaneous updates: mostly about Wreathe</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Futuramerlin Web site should eventually become a Web site for Futuramerlin again, and Ember moved to a new home. (That's not really news, just mentioning it since it still hasn't happened.)</li>
<li>The "stream registry" features of <a href="/ancillary/crystallize/">Crystallize</a> are deprecated (inasmuch as they were ever supported to begin with); <a href="http://borgbackup.org/">BorgBackup</a> is in my opinion a superior replacement for the stream registry feature's objective of versioned archiving of documents. I'll only be maintaining the stream registry feature to the extent needed to migrate the data out of the format.</li>
<li>Warcdealer is no longer supported. The documentation is available at <a href="https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-web-site/tree/0e2bb1ad2ed62dcaf58f303887bf55ef3849fdde/ancillary/warcdealer">an old commit of the Web site repository</a> if anyone still wants it. I may later try something in the general theme as part of </li>
<li>In the unlikely event that anyone is using Wreathe GNU/Linux:
<ul>
<li>Wreathe 7.3 will probably arrive eventually, but it's hard to say when.</li>
<li>If anyone wants a relatively normal GNU distribution, I suggest switching away from Wreathe to <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a> (or one of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html">these other free distributions</a> if you prefer).</li>
<li>Wreathe 8 and later will probably not be a normal GNU distribution, and instead be a <a href="/specification/engineering-and-tech/computing/software/">DDC environment</a> over a minimal base system. This would presumably not have the same feature set as past Wreathe versions, hence the recommendation to switch to Guix or similar for something similar to these past Wreathe versions.</li>
<li>Wreathe 7.3 should include a preliminary version of the DDC environment for testing, in some form or another.</li>
</ul>
