<h1>Miscellaneous updates</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Futuramerlin Web site should eventually become a Web site for Futuramerlin again, and Ember moved to a new home.</li>
<li>In the unlikely event that anyone is using Wreathe GNU/Linux:
<ul>
<li>Wreathe 7.3 will probably arrive eventually, but it's hard to say when.</li>
<li>If anyone wants a relatively normal GNU distribution, I suggest switching away from Wreathe to <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a> (or one of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html">these other free distributions</a> if you prefer).</li>
<li>Wreathe 8 and later will probably not be a normal GNU distribution, and instead be a <a href="/specification/engineering-and-tech/computing/software/">DDC environment</a> over a minimal base system. This would presumably not have the same feature set as past Wreathe versions, hence the recommendation to switch to Guix or similar for something similar to these past Wreathe versions.</li>
<li>Wreathe 7.3 should include a preliminary version of the DDC environment for testing, in some form or another.</li>
</ul>
