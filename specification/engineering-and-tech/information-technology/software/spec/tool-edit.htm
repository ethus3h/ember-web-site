<h2>Edit tool introduction</h2>
    <p>The edit tool is one of the native tools included in a full EITE implementation. It allows importing and exporting documents using the EITE library, running documents, and editing documents as dcBasenb (extended Unicode), ELS (not yet implemented), or a whitespace-separated series of integers.</p>
    <p>Here is a screenshot of the edit tool for the Web implementation (found in web/edit.htm in the EITE installation root):

    </p>

<h2>Edit tool interface</h2>
    <p>The edit tool interface for the Web implementation consists of three vertical panels, and a horizontal row of buttons below the three panels. The center panel is where the editable contents of a document are shown. At the top is a dropdown menu for choosing what format to edit the document in. Below this dropdown is a label showing what Dc is currently at the cursor position. The right panel is where the document's output will be shown when it is run. The left panel is for locating and inserting Dcs into the document; clicking one will insert it into the document at the current cursor position. The three buttons in the bottom row allow importing, exporting, or running the document. The import and export buttons have dropdown menus to choose what format to import or export documents as.</p>
    <p>Other implementations may have different user interfaces, but should offer equivalent functionality.</p>
