<h2>EITE implementation runner operation</h2>
    <p>The EITE implementation runner is one of the native tools included in a full EITE implementation. Its purpose is to host and run an instance of the EITE implementation document (eite.sems), by providing the necessary execution environment and running the startEite routine.</p>
