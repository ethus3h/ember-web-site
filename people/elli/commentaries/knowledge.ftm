Any loss is robbing the heritage of the future. If someone's had that pointed out and doesn't then consider themselves an "archivist", I would find it hard to respect them. Being an archivist isn't necessarily succeeding at saving everything, but it is trying to. Yes, it's like standing in a rainstorm and trying to catch all the droplets. I'd condemn anyone who doesn't try to catch the ones they can, and wouldn't blame everyone in the future from condemning the entire past for every droplet that was let fall (I certainly do often enough, although it is more emotional than rational). If one makes a considered decision that imperfect restoration is important as a way to ensure preservation, then I don't know that's a problem per se, but just a matter of prioritization (much as I don't try to save all the junk mail I receive, even though I hate that I can't, just because the energy and resources are needed more to preserve other things). That said, the idea that it's more important to make an instrument playable than to preserve it still seems indefensible. Every person's heart should break with every droplet, every piece of heritage or history, that is lost.
