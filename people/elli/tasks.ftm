    - Schedule appointment for car. (207) 622-7327 Open Â· Closes 8 PM Compare prices to consider whether I want wheels or just tires? SCHEDULED FOR Saturday 30 November 2019 at 10:15AM.Address 448 WESTERN AVENUE AUGUSTA. Confirmation code is in the email. [Note 30NovA01Dec2019: Blurry note on my hand is from this morning, and says, IIRC, which I'm pretty sure I do, "448<br />WnAv" (that's an HTML br tag in there, not what I actually wrote in the note; the note was just on two lines and the br tag is for transcription) which is an abbreviated form of Charlie's's address for getting it out to the car and entered into the GPS. I think at first it said WAv and I went back and added a subscript-ish n to make it clearer that it meant Western rather than West, if I recall correctly, which I'm pretty sure I do.]

Both are only 100 pages, and each easy enough to read in an afternoon. Of course, there is Gamma et al's <i>Design Patterns</i>" (referenced from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4361553/what-is-the-difference-between-public-private-and-protected)
