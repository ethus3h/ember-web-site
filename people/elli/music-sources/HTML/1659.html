Global Warming.
</h3>
<p>
The livestock industry “is responsible for nearly 20 percent of the greenhouse gases”[9], such as methane, “released into the atmosphere worldwide”[9], due to its being released by manure from the livestock as it decomposes. Greenhouse gases are the primary cause of global warming. Global warming is a major threat to the environment. It can cause major rises in the worldwide ocean levels; if it does so, many communities will be flooded, leading to crowding. It can cause major change in climate, leading to the destruction of the native habitat and extinction of species.
