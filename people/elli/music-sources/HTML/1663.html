Brain Damage.

<p>
A European country recently had to burn many livestock due to an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which is caused by the addition of livestock, their blood, and returned meat from the supermarkets into the feed which is then fed to the livestock. This same-species' eating can cause significant health issues, as it can affect non-livestock species. The livestock in factory farms are nearly always fed inorganic, unhealthy feed consisting mainly of grains, which the livestock are not intended to eat. They are intended to eat grass: they are ruminants.
