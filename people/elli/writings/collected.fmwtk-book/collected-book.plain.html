<h4>Copy of dynamic Web site content</h4>
    <p>The dynamic content of the Web site is mostly mirrored in static form <a href="https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-web-site/tree/master/static">[https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-web-site/tree/master/static]: in the Web site's Git repository</a> and consequently <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/static">[http://futuramerlin.com/static]: in the site</a> as well. This process is not automated to occur regularly, and the static copy may be out of date.</p>
<h3>Philosophy and Rationale</h3>


<h4>Goals</h4>

    <p>An Ember community should provide useful elements of survival: shelter, nutrition (including food and water), goods and supplies, medical care, services, education, and information. It would do this as its fulfilment of its objective of managing the various needs of a society, by enabling people to be effective participants in that society.</p>

    <p>One role of an Ember community would be to provide goods. For this, it would be ideal for the community to control as much of the supply chain in use as possible. That would allow efficient provision of the goods such as to reduce cost and to ensure quality, reproducibility, sustainability, and locality. That control of the supply chain would, in an ideal scenario, extend to all stages of the process, from production of the raw materials to component production to assembly to distribution, as well as shipping at all stages of the process.</p>

    <p>In the interest of allowing democratic self-government, there should be a universally and easily accessible facility to allow the community to vote easily, with systems in place to prevent voter suppression or intimidation.</p>

<h4>Project structure and implementation</h4>
    <p>Ember will achieve these goals through creating individual components that each provide an integral part of the whole societal system. Implementation will probably need to be undertaken in stages.</p>

<h4>Rationale</h4>
    <p>Human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, a unified institution with the aim of remedying these issues should be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures. Participation in Ember communities shall be dependent on agreement to specified terms, to best protect the rights of the individuals making up the community.</p>

<h4>Licensing</h4>
    <p>Aside from sections 2 and 3 of the <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/library">[http://futuramerlin.com/library]: Ember Library</a>, all portions of the Ember project should be compliant with the Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements, and all portions of the project original to Ember should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements. This is likely not yet a legally effective license, due to a lack of available legal expertise to work on it, and consequently, most of the Ember project and its <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/ancillary">[http://futuramerlin.com/ancillary]: ancillary projects</a> are licensed under the GNU Affero GPL, version 3 (see the licensing information in each individual repository for details). The term "Information", in these requirements, refers to things such as music, software, computer typefaces, visual art, patents and inventions, specifications, schematics for equipment, <span class="foreign-word">etc</span>. (By their nature, sections 2 and 3 of the library cannot practically be fully libre at present; see the "Library" section of the proposal for further information and rationale.)</p>

    <h6>Rationale</h6>
        <p>These licensing requirements are present to attempt to prevent regressions in the availability and utility of the Ember project.</p>

    <h6>Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements (EMFR)</h6>
        <p>For given Information to be compliant with this standard, the following must be true:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important-word">Self-contained</span>: All information necessary for the full and complete use of the Information must also be EMFR-compliant.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Redistributable</span>: The Information must be legally redistributable.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Source included</span>: The preferred form for editing the Information must be available and EMFR-compliant; when used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, if the Information is in a form that is not the preferred form for editing it, a copy of the Information in the preferred form for editing it must always be included with the other copy.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Notice of terms</span>: When used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Irrevocable</span>: The restrictions on the Information that make it EMFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Unencumbered and unencumbering</span>: The Information may not employ any means to prevent or hinder copying or using it freely (<span class="foreign-word">e.g.</span> DRM); furthermore, if the Information enables access to information that employs such means, the Information must not be complicit in facilitating those restrictions (for instance, an EMFR-compliant app that allows streaming DRM-protected content to an HDMI content-protection–enabled monitor MUST enable that content to be used freely by the user, and may not simply pass protected content through to the monitor without being able to decrypt it and enable its free use by the user; software like Firefox's content-decryption-module sandbox is thus not EMFR-compliant).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h6>Ember Freedom Requirements (EFR)</h6>
        <p>This is the same as the Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements, with the following additional restrictions:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important-word">Requiring non-misleading attribution</span>: Attribution to the source of the Information must be required; if the Information is a derivative work, it must be made clear that it has been modified from the source information.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Editable</span>: It must be legal to modify the Information, and to redistribute both modified and/or unmodified copies of the Information.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Mandatory publication</span>: The Information must be promptly published and made widely available publicly at the cost of distribution or less.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Copyleft</span>: These requirements must be required to apply to all derivative works of the Information, and must be required to apply to all information packaged with the Information (<span class="foreign-word">e.g.</span>, non-EFR-compliant firmware may not be provided with an EFR-compliant kernel).</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Inherited</span>: New information created using the Information must be EFR-compliant.<!-- Requiring only EMFR creation here allows the information to devolve into proprietary information. --></li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Provision as a service</span>: When the Information is provided as a service (as in the case of software being run on a server), the Information must be made readily available to those who access the service, and documentation of these requirements must be provided with the service.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Notice of terms</span>: Documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Restricted use</span>: The Information may not itself be used as or as part of advertisement or propaganda without the agreement of its creator or creators, although it may be used as a tool for the creation of advertisement or propaganda.</li>
                <li><span class="important-word">Irrevocable</span>: The restrictions on the Information that make it EFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.</li>
                <!-- Things to deal with patent grants and such are presumably also necessary. -->
            </ul>
        </p>

<h4>Designs</h4>
    <p>The Ember project should develop designs for things such as clothing, tools, and housing. Any finished design provided by the project should conform to some specific traits.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="important-word">Buildable</span>: All technologies and materials needed to build, use, and disassemble the design must also meet these design requirements, and must be fully specified in this document, with reference within the design to those other design specifications, so that every design listed here can be built, used, and disassembled without any knowledge outside of this document, beginning with only the materials available naturally.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Deconstructable</span>: The design should be able to be disassembled and/or reassembled without any damage or loss to the materials used.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Materials</span>: All materials needed to build and use a design should be:
            <ul>
                <li>readily available (not rare or geographically restricted)</li>
                <li>in a form that can be efficiently returned to a natural state if desired at the end of their lifespan (many plastics, for instance, would fail this criterion unless an energy-efficient tool for reversing their creation is available)</li>
                <li>all technologies needed for their sourcing, processing, and end-of-life processing must meet these requirements</li>
                <li>in a form that will return to a natural material over time (the goal of this rule is to avoid materials that result in nonbiodegradeable litter like the microparticles that synthetic textiles sometimes produce; it could probably be better expressed)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Rugged</span>: All item designs should be long-lasting (not disposable, able to function for many years), rugged, and able to function in adverse conditions.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Safe</span>: All designs should be safe to build, use, disassemble, and biodegrade.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Reliable</span>: All designs should work predictably and reliably.</li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Libre</span>: The designs should follow the principles needed to ensure they are freely usable, drafted here under "Licensing".
            <ul>
                <li>Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="important-word">Incremental</span>: This project should be attempted in an incremental, scalable manner, rather than creating a complex system that would need to be implemented all at once to be effective. That way, small improvements can be made without attempting the insurmountable task of improving larger components of society at once. This incremental development would also allow using the strengths of other current and future projects and systems, and collaborating with and complementing them more effectively.</li>
    </ul>

<!--
The structure of this document is based on "Text-based project proposal: Template" (Jon Ippolito).

Note that the structure is slightly different than in the template, to present the most relevant and accessible information first, with lengthier and more abstruse sections placed later. This proposal incorporates some earlier writings on the project.

Title (working title): Community Resources Development Project: Proposal without information technology environment

This version of the proposal has nothing at all to do with computers / electronic communication technology / information technology!

Human connections will be critical for the success of this project. If you're interested on working on a hackable community, please contact me! I can be reached at (207) 200-5386 (please leave a voicemail). Thanks!

# Abstract

This proposal introduces a project to develop and facilitate collaboration on a specification, a library, and a model community, to serve as resources and infrastructure for innovative communities.

# Computer-free project strategy

This is a modified version of the proposal to illustrate that information technology systems are not a critical part of it: it omits all references to or dependency on electronic information technology systems.

Computers are not necessary, central, or even all that relevant to the core goals of this project. They play a role in it as proposed due to how they can simplify, facilitate, and expedite its development, implementation, and use. However, the information technology elements of the proposal could simply be omitted without significant loss or change to the project, and the remainder of the proposal implemented as described (using traditional "paper office" or similar tools for communication, knowledge storage, and management). Taking this further, remote medieval monasteries are perhaps somewhat similar to what this project would look like without any modern technologies, in that they were self-sustaining communities based on a known, adaptable model (and tended towards the preservation of knowledge).

The extensive focus on the information technology aspects in the proposal is largely a product of their impressive capabilities and flexibility, and my personal interest in and frustration with them and their potential, and recognition of the value they could hold for society and this project.

# The problem

There is no project that is successfully systematically supporting the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living. "Libre" refers to the ethical principle of freedom of knowledge, whereby knowledge is provided with the legal protection of rights such as modification and redistribution. (For specifics on this project's goals and strategies in libre licensing, see the "Licensing" section below.) This results in wasted effort on developing redundant proprietary technologies (for instance, multiple non-interoperable word processing apps), regressions in standards of living caused by the unavailability of proprietary systems (for instance, not being able to use the features of a previous version of a word processing app that some capabilities removed), and the incalculable loss of shared cultural heritage through inconsistent or nonexistent archival practices (and in many cases active hostility towards historical preservation, especially in the interest of short-term personal economic gain) (for instance, the loss of many historic films and television series to neglect or deliberate destruction).

There is also no project that is successfully ensuring the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. This results in human suffering and inequality (for instance, the dramatic disparities in income between race, gender, and economic groups), catastrophic cultural and historical loss (for instance, as in the loss of the National Museum of Brazil), and prolonged global ecological crises (for instance, deforestation and climate change) caused by government and corporate apathy and abuse.

These problems are not hypothetical. They are very real and ongoing problems, and are actively causing very real and ongoing harm.

## Evidence of the problem

For an annotated reading list of evidence supporting the presence of some of the issues this project tackles, see the "Evidence of the problem" section of the bibliography at the end of this proposal.

## Existing work towards solving this problem

Many existing projects address various aspects of the issues this project addresses. None seems to cohesively aim to integrate these aspects into a comprehensive libre framework and model implementation, though, driving the need for this project. For an annotated list of related projects and inspirations to this project, see the "Related projects and inspirations" section of the bibliography at the end of this proposal.

# General approach

This project should aim to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living, and to ensure the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. The communities should attempt to provide a consistent and complete experience to the people who are part of them, without depending on support from external infrastructure, technology, or government. Relying on external support increases fragility.

This is a multifaceted project to develop a scalable environment for building an effective, just, and efficient society; consequently, it is quite broad in scope. To organize the broad scope of this project, it is currently divided into four primary areas of work: 
- A specification of principles and methods on which the project is based
- A community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project
- An information technology environment
- A library of knowledge and great cultural works

# Expected outcomes

- Project objectives completed
  - Support and ongoing development of the project's intellectual deliverables, all of which (with the exceptions of parts 2 and 3 of the library) should be libre-licensed
    - Specifications
      - Philosophy and rationale
      - Community
      - Technology and engineering
      - Goods and services
    - Library of knowledge and great cultural works
  - A self-sustaining financially, technologically, and resource-independent community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project, and to serve as a model for other communities using this strategy
  - Distribution of the knowledge assets, allowing a decentralized network of communities using these specifications

# Tasks list

## Planning and strategy
- The most important tasks are also the most difficult. Developing assets (specifications, etc.) is trivial compared to developing communication skills and establishing allies.
- My role in this project should be to coordinate and facilitate until a person or persons more capable is/are available, and/or until it is self-managed, and my presence or absence would have no appreciable effect on it.

## People and communication
- Establish connections with people. Human connections will be critical for the success of this project.
- Develop effective communication skills and strategies. Without being able to get allies in developing the project, it would be dead in the water.
  - That means being able to express clearly, succinctly, and persuasively the following (at least): _what_ this project is, _why_ it is important and achievable, and _how_ to help with it.
  - This includes both in writing and in person. Improving my in-person communication skills is especially important (my in-person speaking on this project is disastrously bad).

## Finances, budget, and stability
- Finances: Develop a financial strategy and budget requirements.
- While the project still has a bus factor of 1, my personal stability is critical for the project. Barring exceptional circumstances, I should be able to continue working on it through graduation thanks to the university and government's student financial aid, and my family's financial support.
- Significant volunteer involvement and/or external investment will be necessary for a full implementation of this project.

## Steps dependent on interpersonal connections
- Establish the physical community. This will require initial capital of *at least* tens of thousands of US dollars, as well as support for ongoing expenses.
- Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project
- Ensure that organization's financial stability (through sources such as an endowment and grants)
- Transfer control of the project's assets to that organization

## Development

These tasks are much less important than the above, but are much easier and comprehensible for me. Consequently, this is where most of my work so far has been.

- Develop, write, test, and document specifications
  - Community governance specifications
  - Technology information and specifications (engineering, construction, etc.), without dependencies (enough information should be included to enable full construction of all technologies starting from nature, without any existing knowledge or technology/machinery; this should be _tested_)
- Write/compile the library
  - Write, compile, and organize content for part 1 of the library
    - Specifications (from above)
    - Subject area information (history, mathematics, linguistics, engineering, etc.)
  - Continue compiling part 2 of the library

# Resources needed

- Communication skills
- Strategic planning
- Team-building skills
- Financial support
- Time
- Stability
  - Financial
  - Personal (finances; energy and focus; time availability)
  - Organizational

# Features of the proposed solution, in detail

## Design principles

These design goals are present to attempt to prevent regressions in the availability and utility of the project.

- Buildable: All technologies and materials needed to build, use, and disassemble the design must also meet these design requirements, and must be fully specified in this document, with reference within the design to those other design specifications, so that every design listed here can be built, used, and disassembled without any knowledge outside of this document, beginning with only the materials available naturally.
- Deconstructable: The design should be able to be disassembled and/or reassembled without any damage or loss to the materials used.
- Materials: All materials needed to build and use a design should be:
  - readily available (not rare or geographically restricted)
  - in a form that can be efficiently returned to a natural state if desired at the end of their lifespan (many plastics, for instance, would fail this criterion unless an energy-efficient tool for reversing their creation is available)
  - all technologies needed for their sourcing, processing, and end-of-life processing must meet these requirements
  - in a form that will return to a natural material over time (the goal of this rule is to avoid materials that result in nonbiodegradeable litter like the microparticles that synthetic textiles sometimes produce; it could probably be better expressed)
- Rugged: All item designs should be long-lasting (not disposable, able to function for many years), rugged, and able to function in adverse conditions.
- Safe: All designs should be safe to build, use, disassemble, and biodegrade.
- Reliable: All designs should work predictably and reliably.
- Libre: The designs should follow the principles needed to ensure they are freely usable, drafted here under "Licensing".
  - Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.
- Incremental: This project should be attempted in an incremental, scalable manner, rather than creating a complex system that would need to be implemented all at once to be effective. That way, small improvements can be made without attempting the insurmountable task of improving larger components of society at once. This incremental development would also allow using the strengths of other current and future projects and systems, and collaborating with and complementing them more effectively.

### Licensing

Aside from sections 2 and 3 of the Ember Library, all portions of the Ember project should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements, and all portions of the project original to Ember should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements. (By their nature, sections 2 and 3 of the library cannot practically be fully libre at present; see the "Library" section of the proposal for further information and rationale.) This is likely not yet a legally effective license, due to a lack of available legal expertise to work on it, and consequently, most of the Ember project and its ancillary projects are licensed under the GNU Affero GPL, version 3 (see the licensing information in each individual repository for details). The term "Information", in these requirements, refers to things such as music, visual art, patents and inventions, specifications, schematics for equipment, etc.

#### Rationale

These licensing requirements are present to attempt to prevent regressions in the availability and utility of the Ember project.

#### Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements (EMFR)

For given Information to be compliant with this standard, the following must be true of it:

- Self-contained: All information necessary for the full and complete use of the Information must also be EMFR-compliant.
- Redistributable: The Information must be legally redistributable.
- Source included: The preferred form for editing the Information must be available and EMFR-compliant; when used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, if the Information is in a form that is not the preferred form for editing it, a copy of the Information in the preferred form for editing it must always be included with the other copy.
- Notice of terms: When used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.
- Irrevocable: The restrictions on the Information that make it EMFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.
- Unencumbered and unencumbering: The Information may not employ any means to prevent or hinder copying or using it freely; furthermore, if the Information enables access to information that employs such means, the Information must not be complicit in facilitating those restrictions.

#### Ember Freedom Requirements (EFR)

This is the same as the Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements, with the following additional restrictions:

- Requiring non-misleading attribution: Attribution to the source of the Information must be required; if the Information is a derivative work, it must be made clear that it has been modified from the source information.
- Editable: It must be legal to modify the Information, and to redistribute both modified and/or unmodified copies of the Information.
- Mandatory publication: The Information must be promptly published and made widely available publicly at the cost of distribution or less.
- Copyleft: These requirements must be required to apply to all derivative works of the Information, and must be required to apply to all information packaged with the Information.
- Inherited: New information created using the Information must be EMFR-compliant.
- Provision as a service: When the Information is provided as a service, the Information must be made readily available to those who access the service, and documentation of these requirements must be provided with the service.
- Notice of terms: Documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.
- Restricted use: The Information may not itself be used as or as part of advertising or propaganda without the agreement of its creator or creators, although it may be used as a tool for the creation of advertising or propaganda.
- Irrevocable: The restrictions on the Information that make it EFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.

## Goals

An Ember community should provide useful elements of survival: shelter, nutrition (including food and water), medical care, education, and information. It would do this as its fulfillment of its objective of managing the various needs of a society, by enabling people to be effective participants in that society.

One role of Ember would be to provide goods. For this, it would be ideal for Ember to control as much of the supply chain as possible. That would allow efficient provision of the goods such as to reduce cost and ensure quality. That control of the supply chain would, in an ideal scenario, extend to all stages of the process, from production of the raw materials to component production to assembly to distribution, as well as shipping at all stages of the process. If Ember both controlled production of raw materials in a region and was the dominant institution working to ensure that those resources are used responsibly, it would of course be important to take the interest Ember has in using the resources sustainably into consideration.

There should be a universally and easily accessible facility to allow the community to vote easily, with systems in place to prevent voter suppression or intimidation.

## Rationale

Human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, a unified institution with the aim of remedying these issues should be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures. Participation in Ember communities shall be dependent on agreement to specified terms, to best protect the rights of the individuals making up the community.

## Specification document

The most significant knowledge assets of the project should comprise a book, which is equivalent to part 1 of the library, with the information technology environment implementation and part 2 of the library provided with it. That could take the form of a physical printed book, or other document format. It should include specifications of the project philosophy and rationale, community, technology and engineering, and goods and services, as well as a carefully prepared compilation of other important knowledge.

## Designs

The Ember project should develop designs for things such as clothing, tools, and housing. Any finished design provided by the project should conform to some specific traits.

## Community

An Ember community is a group of individuals who have chosen to create an Ember community, and to live in accordance with shared principles so as to best protect individuals' rights.

This organization should not impose restrictions on those who chose to become its members apart from those necessary for the protection of their rights, and anyone should be able to choose to become a part of it or to leave it at any time. Joining the organization would involve being listed in a membership file, presumably with sufficient biometric data (photograph, fingerprints, etc.) to prevent identity theft or other fraudulent activity. Names, addresses, or other such personal information, beyond the biometric data previously mentioned, would not be required for the process of becoming a member. Members are not obligated to use any of the services provided by Ember, and could request at any time the termination of any services presently provided to them. In consideration of the "right to die" debate, perhaps people should be able to (revocably, of course, and only if they can give meaningful consent) even request termination of the basic protection of their human rights such as emergency medical care that any community should by default provide as best as possible to anyone regardless of affiliation.

There are many other concerns relevant to the management of a community, as well; a thorough assessment and consideration of management and governance principles and relevant historical experience would be a prerequisite for the development of the community proposed here.

## Services collective

This proposal advocates the creation of a project to develop an adequate infrastructure for managing and providing for the basic needs of society. This organization could exist alongside governments and other social structures, as well as potentially taking their place in the event that they collapse or fail to perform as expected.

Humans have come to expect and rely upon social constructs for their safety and mutual benefit, but human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, there is a need for a unified institution to be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures to provide some semblance of a filling of this void. The general rules of this organization should be established on the basis of rights: rather than making a rule that, for example, prohibits murder, instead a rule should be established that protects individuals’ right to life. In such a way, rules would not be created that infringe freedom more than that which is necessary to retain order in society.

An Ember community's services collective is a not-for-profit that organizes the procurement and distribution of goods and services for its members, and perhaps others as well. The goal of this organization would be to provide any needful things desired by its members for their lives. For instance, if a person chose to receive food through Ember, they could request that it be provided in exchange for labor. Their labor would help contribute to services requested in the future by them or other Ember members. The organization should have 24/7 available buildings staffed by Ember members from whom aid could be sought, such as the furnishing of meals, shelter, clothing, access to information, or other services, in exchange for labor. That way, if an Ember member is in trouble in an unfamiliar town, for instance, with no money, identification (beyond their own body), or other resources, they could go to the local Ember building to receive any services they desire; they could even build up credit in preparation for such an incident by working for the Ember collective prior to taking a trip, for instance, so they would have already earned any services they might want (thus acting as travel insurance, in a sense).

A self-contained automated crop growing system could be constructed that would accept a seed as input and produce crops and more seed as output. This could be used for easily growing many types of plant, by providing different growing instructions and seeds as needed. It could also be built in a way that tries to use energy from the environment efficiently, and avoid excessive use of mains power. This would be helpful in simplifying access to plant products, even plants that are not commonly available easily. This principle could be applied to goods in general, using production on demand to reduce waste and transportation and storage costs. Such a system would require a level of technology that will likely take a while to develop without proprietary dependencies.

## Library

The library is divided into three sections, each increasingly broad in scope. Sections 2 and 3 are the only parts of the project that are not fully libre-licensed, due to the inclusion of non-libre-licensed third-party-owned contents in the libraries. The inclusion of some non-libre contents is justified in these cases because of their cultural and historic importance, because they are not dependencies of any other parts of the project, and in the general interest of preserving knowledge. The non-libre contents should of course not be relied upon outside of their role as cultural knowledge artifacts.

## Library Section 1: Basic knowledge, to be included in the text of the project specification

This section of the library will require research and writing. It should consist of many short sections, each covering a topic. Each of these sections should list all other sections that must be understood as prerequisites for understanding it. Ideally, the dependency tree of every section should culminate in a single section that gives a basic understanding of the dominant language of the reference (probably English, for the forseeable future), so that by translating that one section into another language, every other concept in the reference can be understood by reading its section and its section's prerequisites.

It should include specifications of the project philosophy and rationale, community, technology and engineering, and goods and services.

## Library Section 2: Great cultural works

Work has begun on compiling this section of the library, but its utility is restricted by many relevant assets being under copyright but not libre-licensed.

## Library Section 3: Other knowledge, as practical

# Alignment of the project approach to the traits of the currently emerging new media

Henry Jenkins's article "Eight Traits of the New Media Landscape" provides eight traits that its author observes in the prominent currently emerging new media. This section of the proposal evaluates this project's expression of this set of traits.

The first of these traits is _innovation_. This project proposal is arguably merely an extension and refinement of existing systems, and so may not be considered true innovation, depending on perspective. Even in that case, however, because those existing systems are themselves innovative, this project remains a work within new media, even if it is not itself a new medium.

The second trait is _convergence_. This proposal is highly convergent, being a broadly scoped project to innovate across a wide range of aspects of society, industry, and technology.

The third defining trait is _everyday_ presence. As a project to develop a unified system providing all the knowledge resources needed for running a society, if it is successfully completed and used to its envisioned potential, it would be able to serve as the framework for people's everyday lives.

The fourth trait is _appropriation_. This proposed project ideally will be highly appropriative, because so much work has already been done. It would in all probability be hugely wasteful and impractical to attempt to build everything from scratch, rather than to leverage existing systems (even if only practical through inspiration!) and merely work to fill gaps and integrate the various existing technologies well. That said, reliance on proprietary or externally managed technologies should be eliminated as soon as practical, with all elements of the project and its dependencies being fully libre, because proprietary, non-maintainable, and trade-dependent systems are brittle and are a huge threat to the ability of human society to maintain its standards of living over time. Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.

The fifth trait is _networkedness_. As a design goal for this project, networking should be provided when available, but never mandatory. Systems that depend entirely on networking are, echoing the discussion of the fourth point, brittle. Once constructed, the best tools would be fully usable in a vacuum.

The sixth trait is being _global_. The proposed project is intended to be able to be geographically dispersed, although individual communities would only be able to collaborate on physical projects by being physically colocated, for obvious reasons.

The seventh trait is _generational_. Whether an age gap will affect this project is hard to predict. If it does, it should only be by the choice of individuals, rather than by inaccessibility or prejudice: if people who are a different age than the majority involved in the project, those people should be provided any necessary accommodations to the fullest extent possible (medical care for the elderly, education for the young, and so on).

The eighth trait is _inequality_. Unfortunately, this likely may affect the project initially, because a community would presumably be unable to sufficiently support individuals with some disabilities to modern standards until it was somewhat technologically sophisticated, meaning that people involved in the project would need to be able to provide for themselves and (for the physical community or communities) provide transportation for access, restricting practical use of the project to those who are wealthy or otherwise supported. Working to reduce undesired inequality as much as possible should be a design goal of the project, while promoting diversity and freedom.

## Circulation

Where will you be distributing your meme?

### Immersion: ________________

I should learn to speak about the project so I can explain it in person, and learn to be friends with people in general.

## Standing

What credibility do you have for spreading your meme?

### Face-to-face community: ________________

I would like to use the advantages provided by the University environment during this last year of my attendance to connect with people interested in this project. I am currently the only person working on the project, although I have talked about it briefly in the context of class presentations, and have discussed it a bit with a few professors.

### Influencers: ________________

I hope to connect with people who have skill communicating and connecting with other people who would be interested in the project. I am currently the only person working on the project.

## Manual Vector

How will you inject your meme?

### Clothing

This would be possible, pretty much being a walking poster. It probably would cost a large amount of money to get a professional looking customized shirt, though, and a hand-made one would not necessarily be very convincing.

### Flashmob

There would need to be more people. A single-person flashmob wouldn't be particularly visible.

### Launch event

I don't know how to do this, or what it would involve. It sounds expensive, complicated, and liable to have no one show up....

### Postcards

These could possibly be useful as a way to communicate with people working on the project if they are far away. Until there are distant people, though, they wouldn't be worth the cost (it's expensive to print and mail, and each postcard presumably only would reach a few people, unlike a poster).

### Posters

I have designed a poster to help promote this project.

### Stickers

Stickers could be funded and made. There is a risk that they could become litter or used as vandalism, though, which could harm the project, rather than promote it.

## Payload

What's the smallest unit of meaning you hope to circulate?

### Article: ________________

This proposal could be polished and published.

## Recognition

How will you measure success?

There are two primary success metrics for this semester. One is the progress I make on a prototype and strategy development; another is how many other people I can convince to work on the project with me.

### Money

People with money may become interested in investing it in this project. If so, any contributions and expenditures should be tracked carefully, with the information publicly available to ensure that contributions are used efficiently. Only my personal funds are used at present.

### Credibility (Diggs/Karma)

As an undergraduate student with good grades, I have a moderate but fairly low amount of credibility. My lack of work experience in related fields may affect that as well. (My résumé is available publicly, which can help people evaluate my experience, giving me more credibility.)

### Reader comments

People communicating with me to join forces on working on this project is the primary quantifiable metric of success for this semester, I think.

## Evidence of the problem
- "National Museum of Brazil fire". In _Wikipedia_. This fire exemplifies how organizational apathy to cultural preservation can cause devastating losses.
- "Deforestation". In _Wikipedia_. Deforestation is one highly visible illustration of the damage done by short-term, profit-driven decisionmaking.
- Economic inequality, often correlating with race and gender, arising regardless of individuals' capacity for economic contribution to society, reduces opportunities for social equality or justice.

Title (working title): Community Resources Development Project

Please bear in mind that the computer/document/communication stuff is really just an unimportant tangent to the main point of this project. It's only in this proposal so much because I like working on it.

Human connections will be critical for the success of this project. If you're interested on working on a hackable community, please contact me! I can be reached at (207) 200-5386 (please leave a voicemail). Thanks!

# Abstract

This proposal introduces a project to develop and facilitate collaboration on a specification, a computing environment, a library, and a model community, to serve as resources and infrastructure for innovative communities.

# The problem

There is no project that is successfully systematically supporting the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living. "Libre" refers to the ethical principle of freedom of knowledge, whereby knowledge is provided with the legal protection of rights such as modification and redistribution. (For specifics on this project's goals and strategies in libre licensing, see the "Licensing" section below.) This results in wasted effort on developing redundant proprietary technologies (for instance, multiple non-interoperable word processing apps), regressions in standards of living caused by the unavailability of proprietary systems (for instance, not being able to use the features of a previous version of a word processing app that some capabilities removed), and the incalculable loss of shared cultural heritage through inconsistent or nonexistent archival practices (and in many cases active hostility towards historical preservation, especially in the interest of short-term personal economic gain) (for instance, the loss of many historic films and television series to neglect or deliberate destruction).

There is also no project that is successfully ensuring the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. This results in human suffering and inequality (for instance, the dramatic disparities in income between race, gender, and economic groups), catastrophic cultural and historical loss (for instance, as in the loss of the National Museum of Brazil), and prolonged global ecological crises (for instance, deforestation and climate change) caused by government and corporate apathy and abuse.

These problems are not hypothetical. They are very real and ongoing problems, and are actively causing very real and ongoing harm.

## Evidence of the problem

For an annotated reading list of evidence supporting the presence of some of the issues this project tackles, see the "Evidence of the problem" section of the bibliography at the end of this proposal.

## Existing work towards solving this problem

Many existing projects address various aspects of the issues this project addresses. None seems to cohesively aim to integrate these aspects into a comprehensive libre framework and model implementation, though, driving the need for this project. For an annotated list of related projects and inspirations to this project, see the "Related projects and inspirations" section of the bibliography at the end of this proposal.

# General approach

This project should aim to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living, and to ensure the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. The communities should attempt to provide a consistent and complete experience to the people who are part of them, without depending on support from external infrastructure, technology, or government. Relying on external support increases fragility.

This is a multifaceted project to develop a scalable environment for building an effective, just, and efficient society; consequently, it is quite broad in scope. To organize the broad scope of this project, it is currently divided into four primary areas of work: 
- A specification of principles and methods on which the project is based
- A community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project
- An information technology environment
- A library of knowledge and great cultural works

## Current project status

"Ember" is the current name of this project.

The primary components comprising the project are currently unfinished, but a variety of software maintained to facilitate the development of the project is available.

The main output of the project so far has been the successful development of two well-tested, partially completed software applications that are currently used to facilitate the further development of the project. The first of these is a static Web site generator, which is used to build the project's Web site (it includes working features for theming using CSS, with some included themes, automatic blog pagination, and discography Web site generation for musicians). The second of these is a suite of tools for working with file version tracking, document archiving, and data storage and distribution. It is currently in use for storing and managing the more than eleven million files and forty version control repositories used now for the project, as well as the structured archiving of more than eighteen million additional documents outside of the project.

Other parts of the project are also begun. (The technical specifications and other data produced so far for the project are not included in this proposal document.)

# Expected outcomes

- Completed, stable software environment used for developing the project
- Project objectives completed
  - Support and ongoing development of the project's intellectual deliverables, all of which (with the exceptions of parts 2 and 3 of the library) should be libre-licensed
    - Specifications
      - Philosophy and rationale
      - Community
      - Technology and engineering
      - Goods and services
    - Information technology environment software implementation
    - Library of knowledge and great cultural works
  - A self-sustaining financially, technologically, and resource-independent community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project, and to serve as a model for other communities using this strategy
    - Managed, geographically-redundant computing infrastructure and data archiving
  - Distribution of the knowledge assets, allowing a decentralized network of communities using these specifications
    - Ideally, the entirety of the knowledge assets (perhaps excluding section 3 of the library) would be available in a wristband storage format, or something similar, ensuring that every person carries the entirety of the contents of the project with them, essentially becoming human backups of the data, and with any single person having the knowledge necessary to recreate the entire project and all its technology if they want. Printed books should also be available and distributed to libraries.
    - The cloud computing infrastructure should use a decentralized, asynchronously resolving append-only data store, similar to blockchains, to ensure the preservation and longevity of data stored using it as best as possible.

# Tasks list

## Planning and strategy
- The most important tasks are also the most difficult. Developing assets (specifications, software, etc.) is trivial compared to developing communication skills and establishing allies. There's a reason there are several usable computer programs developed for this project, but no other people working on it.
- My role in this project should be to coordinate and facilitate until a person or persons more capable is/are available, and/or until it is self-managed, and my presence or absence would have no appreciable effect on it.

### Timeline

![Gantt chart](ProjectGanttChart2018sept18-v5-2018sept25.png)

## People and communication
- Establish connections with people. Human connections will be critical for the success of this project.
- Develop effective communication skills and strategies. Without being able to get allies in developing the project, it would be dead in the water.
  - That means being able to express clearly, succinctly, and persuasively the following (at least): _what_ this project is, _why_ it is important and achievable, and _how_ to help with it.
  - This includes both in writing and in person. Improving my in-person communication skills is especially important (my in-person speaking on this project is disastrously bad).

## Finances, budget, and stability
- Finances: Develop a financial strategy and budget requirements. As a single, close to broke student without employment or a degree (yet), or a rich family giving me a small loan of a million dollars, I can barely support keeping the lights on for the Web site. (Hosting is going to expire in October, and I haven't figured out how I'm going to pay for it for the next few years. It's somewhere in the US$5/month range. The domain name registration (`futuramerlin.com`) is good through the end of 2022, at which point it will need renewal, which is about US$10/year.) The most recent costs of technical infrastructure is US$106.20 for three years of Web hosting, plus US$83.76 for eight year ownership of domain name. A rough estimate of the cost for the semester of Web hosting is therefore US$17.70, and the cost for the semester of the domain name is US$5.24.
- While the project still has a bus factor of 1, my personal stability is critical for the project. Barring exceptional circumstances, I should be able to continue working on it through graduation thanks to the university and government's student financial aid, and my family's financial support.
- Significant volunteer involvement and/or external investment will be necessary for a full implementation of this project.

### Detailed budget estimates

All figures are rough estimates.

## Steps dependent on interpersonal connections
- Establish the physical community. This will require initial capital of *at least* tens of thousands of US dollars, as well as support for ongoing expenses.
- Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project
- Ensure that organization's financial stability (through sources such as an endowment and grants)
- Transfer control of the project's assets (Web presence, etc.) to that organization

## Development

These tasks are much less important than the above, but are much easier and comprehensible for me. Consequently, this is where most of my work so far has been.

- Develop, write, test, and document specifications
  - Community governance specifications
  - Technology information and specifications (engineering, construction, information technology, etc.), without dependencies (enough information should be included to enable full construction of all technologies starting from nature, without any existing knowledge or technology/machinery; this should be _tested_)
- Continue development of support software
- Develop software for information technology environment (EITE)
  - Finish specifying and build JavaScript implementation of portable, trivial staging language (StageL)
  - Port existing EITE implementation to StageL
  - Provide and implement StageL inside EITE
  - Get text rendering implemented in EITE
  - UI widgets
  - Implement simple document editor in EITE
  - Complex text rendering support
  - Other EITE development tasks: networking, data storage and distribution, etc.
  - Write C implementation of StageL
  - Benchmark JavaScript implementation versus C→WebAssembly, out of curiosity. WASM would require clang in the toolchain, which wouldn't be ideal until clang can be run on non-WASM EITE, but anyway...
  - An alternative strategy could omit implementing the technology, and only focusing on developing the specification, although that strategy would risk increasing the problems the project is intended to fix (by providing existing IT companies with the project’s technological innovations, but not having a free/libre implementation of them to prevent existing companies using distorted clones of the idea to further their proprietary goals and vendor lock-in).
- Write/compile the library
  - Write, compile, and organize content for part 1 of the library
    - Specifications (from above)
    - Subject area information (history, mathematics, linguistics, engineering, etc.)
  - Continue compiling part 2 of the library
- (Dependent on additional finances, land, and people) Provide physical cloud computing infrastructure
- Figure out how to connect the community's network to the Internet, somehow (its connection shouldn't be dependent on external parties: it should follow the Internet Archive's model of being an AS with peering agreements) to allow accessing and preserving the knowledge there. In accordance with avoiding dependencies on external resources, the Internet should likely not be relied on for providing connectivity, although at least in the beginning it is useful for communication to facilitate the project, and perhaps the benefits of providing Internet-based remote login to the information technology environment would outweigh the risks.

# Features of the proposed solution, in detail

## Design principles

These design goals are present to attempt to prevent regressions in the availability and utility of the project.

- Buildable: All technologies and materials needed to build, use, and disassemble the design must also meet these design requirements, and must be fully specified in this document, with reference within the design to those other design specifications, so that every design listed here can be built, used, and disassembled without any knowledge outside of this document, beginning with only the materials available naturally.
- Deconstructable: The design should be able to be disassembled and/or reassembled without any damage or loss to the materials used.
- Materials: All materials needed to build and use a design should be:
  - readily available (not rare or geographically restricted)
  - in a form that can be efficiently returned to a natural state if desired at the end of their lifespan (many plastics, for instance, would fail this criterion unless an energy-efficient tool for reversing their creation is available)
  - all technologies needed for their sourcing, processing, and end-of-life processing must meet these requirements
  - in a form that will return to a natural material over time (the goal of this rule is to avoid materials that result in nonbiodegradeable litter like the microparticles that synthetic textiles sometimes produce; it could probably be better expressed)
- Rugged: All item designs should be long-lasting (not disposable, able to function for many years), rugged, and able to function in adverse conditions.
- Safe: All designs should be safe to build, use, disassemble, and biodegrade.
- Reliable: All designs should work predictably and reliably.
- Libre: The designs should follow the principles needed to ensure they are freely usable, drafted here under "Licensing".
  - Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.
- Incremental: This project should be attempted in an incremental, scalable manner, rather than creating a complex system that would need to be implemented all at once to be effective. That way, small improvements can be made without attempting the insurmountable task of improving larger components of society at once. This incremental development would also allow using the strengths of other current and future projects and systems, and collaborating with and complementing them more effectively.

### Licensing

Aside from sections 2 and 3 of the Ember Library, all portions of the Ember project should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements, and all portions of the project original to Ember should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements. (By their nature, sections 2 and 3 of the library cannot practically be fully libre at present; see the "Library" section of the proposal for further information and rationale.) This is likely not yet a legally effective license, due to a lack of available legal expertise to work on it, and consequently, most of the Ember project and its ancillary projects are licensed under the GNU Affero GPL, version 3 (see the licensing information in each individual repository for details). The term "Information", in these requirements, refers to things such as music, software, computer typefaces, visual art, patents and inventions, specifications, schematics for equipment, etc.

#### Rationale

These licensing requirements are present to attempt to prevent regressions in the availability and utility of the Ember project.

#### Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements (EMFR)

For given Information to be compliant with this standard, the following must be true of it:

- Self-contained: All information necessary for the full and complete use of the Information must also be EMFR-compliant.
- Redistributable: The Information must be legally redistributable.
- Source included: The preferred form for editing the Information must be available and EMFR-compliant; when used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, if the Information is in a form that is not the preferred form for editing it, a copy of the Information in the preferred form for editing it must always be included with the other copy.
- Notice of terms: When used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.
- Irrevocable: The restrictions on the Information that make it EMFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.
- Unencumbered and unencumbering: The Information may not employ any means to prevent or hinder copying or using it freely (_e.g._ DRM); furthermore, if the Information enables access to information that employs such means, the Information must not be complicit in facilitating those restrictions (for instance, an EMFR-compliant app that allows streaming DRM-protected content to an HDMI content-protection–enabled monitor MUST enable that content to be used freely by the user, and may not simply pass protected content through to the monitor without being able to decrypt it and enable its free use by the user; software like Firefox's content-decryption-module sandbox is thus not EMFR-compliant).

#### Ember Freedom Requirements (EFR)

This is the same as the Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements, with the following additional restrictions:

- Requiring non-misleading attribution: Attribution to the source of the Information must be required; if the Information is a derivative work, it must be made clear that it has been modified from the source information.
- Editable: It must be legal to modify the Information, and to redistribute both modified and/or unmodified copies of the Information.
- Mandatory publication: The Information must be promptly published and made widely available publicly at the cost of distribution or less.
- Copyleft: These requirements must be required to apply to all derivative works of the Information, and must be required to apply to all information packaged with the Information (_e.g._, non-EFR-compliant firmware may not be provided with an EFR-compliant kernel).
- Inherited: New information created using the Information must be EMFR-compliant.
- Provision as a service: When the Information is provided as a service (as in the case of software being run on a server), the Information must be made readily available to those who access the service, and documentation of these requirements must be provided with the service.
- Notice of terms: Documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.
- Restricted use: The Information may not itself be used as or as part of advertising or propaganda without the agreement of its creator or creators, although it may be used as a tool for the creation of advertising or propaganda.
- Irrevocable: The restrictions on the Information that make it EFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.

## Goals

An Ember community should provide useful elements of survival: shelter, nutrition (including food and water), medical care, education, and information. It would do this as its fulfillment of its objective of managing the various needs of a society, by enabling people to be effective participants in that society.

One role of Ember would be to provide goods. For this, it would be ideal for Ember to control as much of the supply chain as possible. That would allow efficient provision of the goods such as to reduce cost and ensure quality. That control of the supply chain would, in an ideal scenario, extend to all stages of the process, from production of the raw materials to component production to assembly to distribution, as well as shipping at all stages of the process. If Ember both controlled production of raw materials in a region and was the dominant institution working to ensure that those resources are used responsibly, it would of course be important to take the interest Ember has in using the resources sustainably into consideration.

There should be a universally and easily accessible facility to allow the community to vote easily, with systems in place to prevent voter suppression or intimidation.

## Rationale

Human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, a unified institution with the aim of remedying these issues should be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures. Participation in Ember communities shall be dependent on agreement to specified terms, to best protect the rights of the individuals making up the community.

## Specification document

The most significant knowledge assets of the project should comprise a book, which is equivalent to part 1 of the library, with the information technology environment implementation and part 2 of the library provided with it. That could take the form of an ebook, a physical printed book, or other innovative document formats. It should include specifications of the project philosophy and rationale, community, technology and engineering, and goods and services, as well as a carefully prepared compilation of other important knowledge.

## Designs

The Ember project should develop designs for things such as clothing, tools, and housing. Any finished design provided by the project should conform to some specific traits.

## Community

An Ember community is a group of individuals who have chosen to create an Ember community, and to live in accordance with shared principles so as to best protect individuals' rights.

This organization should not impose restrictions on those who chose to become its members apart from those necessary for the protection of their rights, and anyone should be able to choose to become a part of it or to leave it at any time. Joining the organization would involve being listed in the central Ember computing environment database, presumably with sufficient biometric data to prevent identity theft or other fraudulent activity. Names, addresses, or other such personal information, beyond the biometric data previously mentioned, would not be required for the process of becoming a member. Members are not obligated to use any of the services provided by Ember, and could request at any time the termination of any services presently provided to them. In consideration of the "right to die" debate, perhaps people should be able to (revocably, of course, and only if they can give meaningful consent) even request termination of the basic protection of their human rights such as emergency medical care that any community should by default provide as best as possible to anyone regardless of affiliation.

There are many other concerns relevant to the management of a community, as well; a thorough assessment and consideration of management and governance principles and relevant historical experience would be a prerequisite for the development of the community proposed here.

## Services collective

This proposal advocates the creation of a project to develop an adequate infrastructure for managing and providing for the basic needs of society. This organization could exist alongside governments and other social structures, as well as potentially taking their place in the event that they collapse or fail to perform as expected.

Humans have come to expect and rely upon social constructs for their safety and mutual benefit, but human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, there is a need for a unified institution to be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures to provide some semblance of a filling of this void. The general rules of this organization should be established on the basis of rights: rather than making a rule that, for example, prohibits murder, instead a rule should be established that protects individuals’ right to life. In such a way, rules would not be created that infringe freedom more than that which is necessary to retain order in society.

An Ember community's services collective is a not-for-profit that organizes the procurement and distribution of goods and services for its members, and perhaps others as well. The goal of this organization would be to provide any needful things desired by its members for their lives. For instance, if a person chose to receive food through Ember, they could request that it be provided in exchange for labor. Their labor would help contribute to services requested in the future by them or other Ember members. The organization should have 24/7 available buildings staffed by Ember members from whom aid could be sought, such as the furnishing of meals, shelter, clothing, access to information, or other services, in exchange for labor. That way, if an Ember member is in trouble in an unfamiliar town, for instance, with no money, identification (beyond their own body), or other resources, they could go to the local Ember building to receive any services they desire; they could even build up credit in preparation for such an incident by working for the Ember collective prior to taking a trip, for instance, so they would have already earned any services they might want (thus acting as travel insurance, in a sense).

A self-contained automated crop growing system could be constructed that would accept a seed as input and produce crops and more seed as output. This could be used for easily growing many types of plant, by providing different growing instructions and seeds as needed. It could also be built in a way that tries to use energy from the environment efficiently, and avoid excessive use of mains power. This would be helpful in simplifying access to plant products, even plants that are not commonly available easily. This principle could be applied to goods in general, using production on demand to reduce waste and transportation and storage costs. Such a system would require a level of technology that will likely take a while to develop without proprietary dependencies.

## Library

The library is divided into three sections, each increasingly broad in scope. Sections 2 and 3 are the only parts of the project that are not fully libre-licensed, due to the inclusion of non-libre-licensed third-party-owned contents in the libraries. The inclusion of some non-libre contents is justified in these cases because of their cultural and historic importance, because they are not dependencies of any other parts of the project, and in the general interest of preserving knowledge. The non-libre contents should of course not be relied upon outside of their role as cultural knowledge artifacts.

## Library Section 1: Basic knowledge, to be included in the text of the project specification

This section of the library will require research and writing. It should consist of many short sections, each covering a topic. Each of these sections should list all other sections that must be understood as prerequisites for understanding it. Ideally, the dependency tree of every section should culminate in a single section that gives a basic understanding of the dominant language of the reference (probably English, for the forseeable future), so that by translating that one section into another language, every other concept in the reference can be understood by reading its section and its section's prerequisites.

It should include specifications of the project philosophy and rationale, community, technology and engineering, and goods and services.

## Library Section 2: Great cultural works, to be included as digital data with the project specification

Work has begun on compiling this section of the library, but its utility is restricted by many relevant assets being under copyright but not libre-licensed.

## Library Section 3: The data held by the EITE cloud infrastructure

This section of the library will presumably be too much information to be included in the project specification, although future information storage technology advances may render that less of an issue.

## Information technology environment

### Introduction

This section proposes developing an information technology system that allows various types of data to be given a first-class role. The proposed system is a centralized but non-centralization-dependent append-only information store, a computer operating system integrated with that information store, and related specifications.

Web-based information technology companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook have a disproportionately large amount of power, have a disproportionately large role in how individuals are able to conduct their daily lives, and are single points of failure for a large portion of the modern lifestyle. These corporations are private institutions with little to no public oversight and control, despite having a large and visible role (perhaps even larger than any one government) in individuals’ lives. To begin to challenge that power structure, this semi-decentralized document-oriented computing platform should be developed that can integrate the abilities of traditional information technology systems into a single, cohesive system. Such a system should be free/libre software, and should be designed in such a way that it can adapt when needed to functioning as a fully decentralized, serverless system, transparently adjusting to the networking capabilities or lack thereof available to it on an ad-hoc basis. The existence of this project as a replacement would prevent single IT companies’ systems being single points of failure, and its distributed model would prevent it itself from being a single point of failure. Additionally, by being fully free/libre software, and by using a single system and data format for the full range of services, this proposal would reduce the dangers created by vendor lock-in, proprietary products, and incompatible IT systems.

People that would be especially benefited by the full form of this project include individuals from marginalized groups, especially those with disabilities, mental illnesses, and the homeless, by enabling them to support themselves through a community and reducing barriers presented to them by discrimination, and by reducing the need for individuals’ dependence on the traditional monetary economy.

An important basic principle of EITE is flexibility. It should allow the user do what they want in an elegant manner, without undue shenanigans, difficult workarounds, or unwanted assistance. It should accommodate various workflows, and be thoroughly customizable. Its default configuration should be simple and easy to use. User interfaces should abstract away technical complexities by default while remaining fully usable, while allowing access to those complexities if desired.

The system should use a single, libre, fully specified data format to store all types of information it processes, and development of the system should strive to ensure that a thorough selection of capabilities are provided out of the box using a consistent and customizable user interface, obviating the need for external apps (which often tend to be inconsistent in things such as internationalization and accessibility). The use of a single data format would allow, for instance, text, structured data, sound, and interactive media such as computer games to all be practically equivalent to each other, such that wherever one could be used, another could be used instead, ensuring thorough flexibility. (External apps should be possible to use, for instance as references to facilitate developing libre alternatives, as well as to provide historical access and allow verifying that libre alternatives are actually equivalent, but while they should be possible to use, they should not be _necessary_ to use.)

### Overview

The computing environment will consist of the following components (subject to change):

- Development principles, describing the process to use for creating the computing environment
- Data formats
  - Specifications
  - Reference implementations
- Data storage: append-only set of records, each comprising a unique ID paired with a node document
- Client app
- Server apps:
  - Public-facing API
  - Search engine
  - Storage backend

### Development principles

- Never remove a feature, capability, or option. If the development of an improved architecture or addition of new features involves scrapping existing code, reintroduce all previously existing capabilities before releasing the changes to the software.
- Make sure that all tests pass when releasing changes to the software.
- Thorough automated unit tests should be provided and kept passing.

#### Prerequisites for code to be added to the repository

- Code must be readable and documented.
- Code must not cause or have failing tests.
- Code should include thorough automatic test coverage.
- Code must address a deviation from the current specification (bug, missing feature, etc.), and may not contain code unrelated to that.

#### How issues should be prioritised

Ordered from highest priority to lowest priority

- Security vulnerabilities
- Functional regressions
- Incorrect results
- Crashes and similar critical usability issues
- Slow code with a significant impact on usability
- Aesthetic regressions
- Minor usability issues
- Slow code with a moderate impact on usability
- Missing features

### Further principles

One of its fundamental elements would be the creation of a cloud-based information technology system, intended to provide effective and efficient information storage and retrieval (ISR). This would likely use an append-only NoSQL database to store a softly directed concept graph. Most or all knowledge can be effectively represented using two basic structures: nodes and relationships. Relationships would be specific types of nodes. Each node would correspond to a document stored as a sequence of character-like digital identifiers ("Dcs") analogous to both characters in a computer character encoding and to assembly language opcodes, allowing all types of electronic data to be stored as strings. These strings would be able to hold any structured data through the use of specific Dcs, such that when a document was added to the ISR system, it could be indexed deterministically into a separate database which would cache the structured information extracted from that document.

The nodes of a graph are the individual records that it stores. Relationships between those nodes are the edges of the graph, although it is possible that the system I am developing will provide for more complex relationships, for example by allowing relationships to connect several nodes to each other in a variety of ways, although whether that proves necessary or useful remains to be seen. Metadata are an item’s traits: information such as the title of a node, or a description of it. The way I have designed this system, placing all three of these types of entity into one table, allows relationships and metadata to have the attributes of nodes: for example, metadata could be attached to a relationship or another metadatum, or relationships could be specified that connect any combination of the three. There are many existing ISR systems, such as flat files and flat searching, flat-search filterable record sets, sorted records, a variety of tree and tree-like structures, tagged or labeled records, traditional tabular databases, relational databases, sparse tables, sparse matrices and entity-attribute-value models, graphs and digraphs, Boolean-queriable datasets, hierarchies, automated natural-language document acquisition and indexing, metadata-enriched natural-language document acquisition and indexing, and selective-display intelligent query results. The system I am proposing would primarily leverage a graph structure augmented through the use of richly labeled nodes, providing great flexibility in the structures it can manage; in addition, the above structures could be emulated within a graph-driven environment for when they are preferred.

This will also provide effective options for implementing the wide variety of existing ISR systems outlined above as both self-hosted applications executed both in the cloud and in userspace.

There are a variety of content sources that would populate this ISR system: publicly available datasets, creative works, and other resources; resources added and/or created by individuals using the system; “dark” content such as is currently held by social networks, governments, and other organizations that do not publicly release their records; moderated content that has been reviewed and fact-checked and annotated as such by the NGO; dynamically generated content; and computed content, for example, the results from a mathematical calculation or an operation on a dataset.

This ISR system should be leveraged by the NGO for several purposes. First, it can be used to record the individuals who are participants in the NGO. Through the development and application of a biometrics system, perhaps similar to that of India’s Aadhaar program, the use of names could be easily foregone, allowing for people who are mononymous, change their name frequently, have unconventional names, have no name, and so on and so forth to easily use the system, without being subjected to the usual tribulations that accompany any of the above in many modern governments. (It would also eliminate similar gender identity and other issues in receiving government services.) While instability of identification traits in individuals, either through subversion of the system or through chance, is indeed a concern, both for positive and negative identification (Sahoo, Choubisa, and Prasanna: “Multimodal Biometric Person Authentication: A Review”. 2012. In _IETE Technical Review_, vol. 29 issue 1, January–February 2012), hopefully a sufficiently deep set of metrics could be established to prevent this from being an issue. When an individual becomes part of the NGO, they would be enrolled in the biometric identification system, and provided a system for communication and tracking of some type. This could take several forms: the most practical and useful, probably, would be a wristwatch-like interface to cloud computing systems that would contain a GPS system and other useful electronics. The purpose of this would be the providing of emergency services: in the event of an emergency, the wearer could interact in it in a way to convey the existence and, if possible, the nature and situation of an emergency. This information would be entered automatically into the ISR system, which would provide a report of the emergency, including the person’s location, their direction and speed of travel, any known health conditions, their current health state (heart rate, blood pressure, and such). The system could automatically delegate the emergency to a nearby station of the NGO, which would act (presumably with the assistance of emergency response services) to resolve the situation.

Education and qualifications could be tracked through this system, as could taxes. For example, when a person completed testing by the organisation in a given subject, that score could be recorded in their profile in such a way that it could be used to determine what jobs they are allowed to work at. Taxation should be managed through time, so that a person would put in a certain number of hours of work selected from the jobs that need doing according to the ISR’s task record tracking system (possibly the number of hours necessary for a given amount of the organization’s services provided would be related to the level of qualification necessary for the work in question) to receive the organisation’s services in exchange. The person could choose which services to allocate their time credits to — for example, requesting food credits, requesting tickets to operas, or donating them to charity. In such a way, the taxes levied would hopefully never have to be put to a use the individual considered unethical. Inter-personal trading could also be facilitated through the ISR system. Such an information technology system to manage and facilitate work by individuals, tracking what needs to be done and what skills people have, and offering jobs to people with the relevant skills, would allow the individuals to bypass the difficult job search and application process, which uses a lot of individuals’ time and energy without producing any real value from that expenditure. Then, when a job is completed, the person who did the work would be granted credits corresponding to the work they did, which could then be exchanged for goods or services. This type of system could be implemented as a single, centralized system. However, it could also be implemented as a decentralized system.

To decentralize such a system, individual computers that make up the information technology system would have to be able to negotiate information sharing between other computers that are accessible via network. If each individual computer has the entire capability to maintain the system, then the network would be able to split and recombine as needed depending on situation.

For instance, two geographically remote implementations of this system would be able to be connected when a network connection between them was available, being able to share work assignments remotely, but if a storm or other situation disrupted the network connection, the two communities’ economies would split into separate economies and continue working independently seamlessly, and then recombine when the network connection returned. In such a system, each individual who has a computer thus has access to and control over that part of the economy. This still leaves one centralized aspect, though, which is the software controlling the economies. If it is community-maintained libre software, that problem is largely eliminated, aside from the usual problems of project governance. If it is preferred, the software could also have facilities for creating ad-hoc centralization, where one instance of the software within each group of instances accessible within a given network would adopt the role of leader. This could be decided automatically, and made fully invisible to users of the system, or through community selection with automatic selection as a fallback, which would probably be preferable so as to ensure that systems with good connectivity and uptime (such as servers in datacenters) were selected as leaders, avoiding unnecessary inefficiency and maximizing reliability.

Thorough user group and subgroup support should be provided. This would be especially useful for facilitating collaboration between individuals, such as in business use of the software.

### Semantic representation

There are two principle structural levels for which elements need to be described: documents and texts. A document is a complete unit such as a book or journal article, which would comprise various textual regions (note that in typesetting some items, such as database records of titles or filenames, only one textual region would be used; in the first, either a "Document Title" or a "Standard" region type would be used, depending on how the database was being queried, that is, the presentation style of the information as a title or as standard text (such as if it were being displayed in a page that contained a list of database fields), and in the second, a "Standard" region type would be used for interface display in lists (other region types might be used at other times) (note that in any use cases when it is in a "Standard" textual region, it would still have the text type Title)). A textual region is a section of content that has one semantic componency, _e.g._ the body of a document or the title; a document is therefore comprised of texts.

- Liberal relationship formation and node typing: A node can be assigned any other node as its type; a relationship can be from any type of node to any other type of node even if that is not how the relationship is defined (this situation could display a warning, for example).
- Authority contexts: Information should be able to be tagged with information on its authority. When used at the node level, as opposed to within document content, authority context information should be validated to ensure the utility of the available nodes (so that the authority context tagging can be used to evaluate the reliability of a given document). For instance, objective consensus, reflecting a neutral point of view, not necessarily trying to represent all points of view equally because of lack of consensus about them, versus subjective individual/organization source, representing an individual or organization's opinion, without necessarily any regard for a neutral point of view, such as in opinion writing or advertising.

A node is a document, represented as a sequence of Dcs, stored in the EITE system. A document created by an individual would presumably, when stored as a node, have additional information not managed by the individual, such as who has the right to read and edit it. Thus, the document an individual would work with would be stored as a portion of a larger document representing its corresponding node. Because the system is append-only, nodes would have revisions, representing each time it was changed. For letter-by-letter changes, produced while typing without saving, instead of saving a new revision, letter-by-letter change tracking and storage could be used, such as is used by Etherpad.

Various fully featured ways to interact with the system should be provided. For instance, a graphical interface, a command-line interface, and a UNIX-style "everything is a file" interface. (Filesystems, especially APIs exposed as filesystem entities have their own challenges and risks, such as confusing scripts that aren't designed to work with anything except plain old files, having unusual structures such as files not present in any directory, infinite directory trees resulting from hardlinks to directories, files with multiple forks, or named pipes, and if providing nodes by filename, having files and directories with the same names or directories with a data fork; these issues will need work and research to resolve well and provide good user experiences.)

#### Complex Dc sequences, Sequence Builders, and Dynamic Sets

A complex sequence of Dcs could be built using special-purpose input tools for constructing them. For instance, purpose-built tools could be provided for constructing a sequence of Dcs representing a mathematical equation, or a sequence of Dcs representing a given time or color.

Similarly, a special type of sequence builder could be used to build sets of values. For instance, for selecting a document to send to someone, a document set builder dialog could be provided. It would allow selecting one or more documents to send manually, or selecting one or more documents by specifying rules for their selection. Then, the set containing the chosen node or nodes (optionally, at their present revision) is saved as a node; that set node is then provided to the person one is communicating to; the same interface could be used for selecting files for working with in an app. Sets could have restrictions, such as regarding how many documents they could contain, whether they could contain complex structures (such as a directory tree), whether one document could be swapped out with another or not, or whether the set should automatically gather new nodes matching the specified rules. Sets could also be driven by search criteria (_e.g._ the most relevant 10 nodes for a given keyword or given Boolean search conditions, or all four nodes with type Musician and a "is member of" relationship to "The Beatles", or the rapidly changing set of nodes with type Musician and a current or past "is member of" relationship to "Yes"), or built programmatically from new or existing nodes. Sets could also hold non-node strings. (Node IDs, as with everything else, can be considered as special cases of strings.) This would allow file uploads, searches, etc. to all be driven using the same basic user interface module, which would essentially be an extension of traditional file pickers. The set node would have a Dc sequence representation, as do all nodes, so this is really a Dc sequence builder. Like anything else in EITE, by virtue of being an append-only system, a set could "time travel": a set could display its contents as they would be at any past time. Another application of the set builder could be creating a document that displayed the current top 10 tracks on the Billboard Hot 100 — a set could be created representing the top 10, and a rule could be created if desired to deal with the condition if the Hot 100 was discontinued: the set could be configured to return nothing, to return a fixed list, to return the top 10 from the final edition of the charts, _et cetera_. A set builder could also be used to select dynamic and non-finite groups of things, such as the set of all integers, or all strings matching a given language syntax; this ability would be similar to the lazy evaluation used frequently in functional programming.

### Implementation challenges and strategy

An implementation of a simple state-machine–driven interpreter of the token-based document format specification for the information technology environment aspect of the project is under way. There have been several previous attempts at developing this, but they have not worked out for various reasons. The first implementation was in PHP, and had poor architecture and rather unmaintainable code. A second attempt in Java was excessively ambitious in attempting to parse a programming-language-style document format interactively, without any specification and only minimal planning or architecture, as well as being highly overengineered. An attempt in PHP and JQuery to build a user interface toolkit based on these principles crashed and burned due to poor code architecture and attempting to “put the cart before the horse” in developing a UI toolkit without any specification for it, and without consideration of the existing (specified) aspects of the format. A fresh attempt in PHP stalled due to also being rather unmaintainable and awkwardly written, specifically in its use of dynamically written JavaScript, and trouble storing arbitrary binary content, independent of character encoding, in HTML text boxes (which are really the wrong tool for the job). An implementation in Bash was considered and a command-line interface designed for it, but probably this will simply become a wrapper around the JavaScript implementation. The JavaScript implementation here will attempt to avoid these issues by only implementing what has already been specified, not attempting to handle the programming-language-style format yet, using extensive unit tests (which was very helpful in the Java implementation), and using modularized code (which has been helpful in successful projects undertaken in the interim), and by planning the architecture of the code (shown in the diagram below) before implementing it. A staging language will be implemented in JavaScript to allow the code written for the project to be trivially portable to other platforms and languages.

What I am able to develop, practically speaking, is simply a technology demo and beginning of an implementation of a tool with larger scope. Consequently, it will presumably be rather limited in its practical utility, making it not suitable for a general audience, and mainly useful as a tool for demonstrating some of the principles used in this project, and as a core starting-point for the implementation of a more substantial and practically useful set of capabilities.

### StageL

#### Overview

A simple programming language should be provided for easily writing portable algorithms to be transpiled to and used by programs in other languages. The name "StageL" comes from calling it a "staging language" (which refers to its being a tool for developing the main EITE software, which should provide a more complete language). This project was inspired by the ugly code that resulted when I tried to write using these principles directly in JavaScript, needing a lot of easy-to-mess-up boilerplate code and awkward notation (largely because it is not strongly typed).

#### Design goals

- Imperative language. Trivial to implement, learn, and read; extremely portable.
- Provide function calls, arrays, strings, numbers, Booleans, and operators for these types with strict typing. Objects and first-class functions are out of scope for this language.
- Commonly used more complex constructs, such as arbitrary-precision numbers and associative arrays, should be offered as abstractions implemented within StageL as part of a common library of reference code.
- Implemented as a transpiler that accepts a file as input and produces a file in the target language as output.
- Have an implementation of itself using itself, to provide testing and portability of the language.
- Have an implementation in Bash.
- Should probably transpile to (at least) JavaScript, C, Java, Bash, PHP, WebAssembly, Microsoft CIL, Lisp, x86 assembly, and Python, in roughly that order of priority. (JavaScript is desired as soon as possible for work on the main EITE software; C and Java should follow soon thereafter for their portability; the other languages are nice to have to cover a diverse range of development environments, and additionally, in the case of CIL/x86 assembly/Lisp, of providing interesting challenges in ensuring that the language really is easily portable due to their difference from the others.)
- Focus on simplicity and portability: it should purely be an algorithm representation format, without input/output capabilities. StageL is for implementing the algorithms of a program once, and having it be available in various languages. Things such as input/output and native calls should be provided as an API specification for the StageL source file: at the top of the file, it should declare all the implementation-dependent functions that it requires; these would then be provided separately by the programmer and/or by a set of functions provided with StageL for each target language.
- All input/output to/from/within the language takes the form of functions. All code must be in a function, with declared parameters, parameter types, variables needed, and return type. (The expense of the simple type system is that changing return values would break functions' API, since "out" parameters and/or pointers would not be available, but this should allow the code to be simple and readable, which is a priority for this language.)
- Output files should retain the structure and comments of the input files, thereby retaining readability as far as the target language permits.
- All behavior should be specified. Ambiguous programs should be impossible to write knowing the specification, and (as far as possible) the meaning of a program should be obvious and unambiguous _without_ the language specification. Programs that do not match the specification exactly should be entirely rejected, rather than produce warnings or have a best guess of its meaning made.

### EITE document formats

There are two conceptually significant document formats for storing EITE data. Both formats consist of a sequence of Dcs. The simpler format would be a simple list of Dcs, similar to a character-based text encoding. The more complex format (the "EITE Language") would be a traditional programming language. The two formats should share a one-to-one equivalency for a given document, and merely be different ways of representing that document.

### EITE Language

Note that the syntax specifications are not included here, as they are lengthy, incomplete, and likely to be changed in the course of further development.

#### Objective

Develop a machine-readable language that can be implemented using StageL, and transpiled into StageL if desired. It should be practically useable as a shell as well as for running stored programs.

#### Language profiles

EITE Language programs may optionally declare a non-default language profile to use: Core, Basic, and Dangerous (the default is "Standard"). Core and Basic both restrict the program to a subset of the language. The Basic language interpreter is written using the Core subset of the language, and provides useful shortcuts to use in the development of the interpreter for the Standard profile. The Default language interpreter is written using the Basic subset of the language. The Dangerous profile allows using language features which are probably a bad idea to use, but may be needed in some cases.

#### Dcs

The core unit of the EITE Language is the Dc (Document Component). The defined Dcs are listed in DcData.csv. An EITE Language document is a list of Dcs, and a file is considered _structurally valid_ if it can be interpreted as such. A Dc can have a syntactical pattern that it can require if it is to be meaningful. For example, a marker to _begin_ a section of a document might be required to have a matching _end_ marker. A document is only _syntactically valid_ if the usage of each Dc contained within it conforms to the Dc's defined syntax, even if the document is otherwise structurally valid.

#### Structures in the EITE Language

The EITE Language uses the following main types of entity to represent information.

##### Type

Types are templates describing the structure of objects. They are known as prototypes or classes in most programming languages, depending on whether objects described by them inherit changes to the types made after the object was created. (Objects can be used as types by casting.) Type names begin with a capital letter when in source form.

##### Object

An object is an entity that conforms to a given type (an _instance_ of that type). The most general type is _object_, and there is no need for an object to conform to any other type.

##### Block

A block is a group of statements.

##### Project

A project is a single document, and if relevant, any other documents maintained as part of that document.

##### Module

A module is one or more Library-mode documents that have a package name for addressing the things they provide.

##### List

A list is an ordered list of objects.

##### String

A string is a list of Dcs. Because all Dcs can be used in strings, any data type can be cast to a string, and all data types internally _are_ strings of Dcs.

##### Routine

A routine is a set of instructions for a computer to follow as part of the process of interpreting a document. Similar concepts are known as functions or subroutines in most programming languages, or as methods when used within objects. Routines have an associated structure that indicates what parameters may be passed to it.

##### Operator

An operator is a short notation or syntax pattern for some common routines (_e.g._, `Number a + Number b` in place of `add(Number a, Number b)`.

##### Identifier

An identifier is a name for an object.

##### Structure

A structure is the definition of what the structure is that an entity can have, similar to type definitions or type signatures in some programming languages. A type can contain named Structures without any values for defining an interface.

##### Statement

A statement is a logical line of a document. It can be an invocation of a routine, or a declaration of an entity's structure or value.

# Alignment of the project approach to the traits of the currently emerging new media

Henry Jenkins's article "Eight Traits of the New Media Landscape" (http://nmdprojects.net/teaching_resources/jenkins_eight_traits_of_new_media.pdf) provides eight traits that its author observes in the prominent currently emerging new media. This section of the proposal evaluates this project's expression of this set of traits.

The first of these traits is _innovation_. This project proposal is arguably merely an extension and refinement of existing systems, and so may not be considered true innovation, depending on perspective. Even in that case, however, because those existing systems are themselves innovative, this project remains a work within new media, even if it is not itself a new medium.

The second trait is _convergence_. This proposal is highly convergent, being a broadly scoped project to innovate across a wide range of aspects of society, industry, and technology. Even regarding only the information technology environment, it is intended to inherit the capabilities of existing computers, which are used for text, sound, image, video, and interactive media, among others.

The third defining trait is _everyday_ presence. As a project to develop a unified system providing all the knowledge resources needed for running a society, if it is successfully completed and used to its envisioned potential, it would be able to serve as the framework for people's everyday lives. When only available in partial form, those portions of it can be used in everyday settings as well (_e.g._ large chunks of my classwork and other data I rely on and use on an everyday basis (personal projects, music library, email, etc.) are stored and managed using software developed in the course of developing this project).

The fourth trait is _appropriation_. This proposed project ideally will be highly appropriative, because so much work has already been done. It would in all probability be hugely wasteful and impractical to attempt to build everything from scratch, rather than to leverage existing systems (even if only practical through inspiration!) and merely work to fill gaps and integrate the various existing technologies well. That said, reliance on proprietary or externally managed technologies should be eliminated as soon as practical, with all elements of the project and its dependencies being fully libre, because proprietary, non-maintainable, and trade-dependent systems are brittle and are a huge threat to the ability of human society to maintain its standards of living over time. Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.

The fifth trait is _networkedness_. As a design goal for this project, networking should be provided when available, but never mandatory. Systems that depend entirely on networking are, echoing the discussion of the fourth point, brittle. A cloud computing–backed virtual digital assistant, for instance, is thoroughly useless in the event of networking being unavailable. Once constructed, the best tools would be fully usable in a vacuum.

The sixth trait is being _global_. The proposed project is intended to be able to be geographically dispersed, although individual communities would only be able to collaborate on physical projects by being physically colocated, for obvious reasons.

The seventh trait is _generational_. Whether an age gap will affect this project is hard to predict. If it does, it should only be by the choice of individuals, rather than by inaccessibility or prejudice: if people who are a different age than the majority involved in the project, those people should be provided any necessary accommodations to the fullest extent possible (medical care for the elderly, education for the young, and so on). This project should not engage in discrimination based on age, although it could only serve adults until a sufficient child protection framework is in place (_e.g._ I think Google doesn't allow kids to use it, so this presumably shouldn't either).

The eighth trait is _inequality_. Unfortunately, this likely may affect the project initially, because a community would presumably be unable to sufficiently support individuals with some disabilities to modern standards until it was somewhat technologically sophisticated, meaning that people involved in the project would need to be able to provide for themselves and (for the physical community or communities) provide transportation for access, restricting practical use of the project to those who are wealthy or otherwise supported. Working to reduce undesired inequality as much as possible should be a design goal of the project, while promoting diversity and freedom.

# "My Viral Media Campaign Plan" questionnaire responses

## Circulation

Where will you be distributing your meme?

### App: ________________

The app can be provided as a Web page, a native app, or a boot-to-app OS. The current version uses a Web page, although it is consequently limited to the restrictions imposed on Web pages by Web browsers.

### Immersion: ________________

I should learn to speak about the project so I can explain it in person, and learn to be friends with people in general.

### YouTube: ________________

A video can be created to introduce people to the project, and hope they will engage in working on it with me.

## Standing

What credibility do you have for spreading your meme?

### App Store reviews: ________________

I have received no comments on the app, although it does not do anything yet from a user perspective (other than use several hundred lines of code to print "Hello, World!", and run very slowly).

### Face-to-face community: ________________

I would like to use the advantages provided by the University environment during this last year of my attendance to connect with people interested in this project. I am currently the only person working on the project, although I have talked about it briefly in the context of class presentations, and have discussed it a bit with a few professors.

### Influencers: ________________

I hope to connect with people who have skill communicating and connecting with other people who would be interested in the project. I am currently the only person working on the project.

### YouTube subscribers: ________________

I have two subscribers on my personal YouTube account, and none on my official account.

## Manual Vector

How will you inject your meme?

### Submitting an app

An app can be distributed as a Web page, as a stand-alone downloadable app (as a file, through operating system package managers), and as a boot-to-app OS. All of these are reasonable distribution platforms for EITE, although likely only native apps would be able to run the server part of the app. (Different platforms have different limitations on what apps are able to accomplish, as a result of environment (hardware, software, network, etc.) limitations.)

### Clothing

This would be possible, pretty much being a walking poster. It probably would cost a large amount of money to get a professional looking customized shirt, though, and a hand-made one would not necessarily be very convincing.

### Flashmob

There would need to be more people. A single-person flashmob wouldn't be particularly visible.

### Launch event

I don't know how to do this, or what it would involve. It sounds expensive, complicated, and liable to have no one show up....

### Postcards

These could possibly be useful as a way to communicate with people working on the project if they are far away. Until there are distant people, though, they wouldn't be worth the cost (it's expensive to print and mail, and each postcard presumably only would reach a few people, unlike a poster).

### Posters

I have designed a poster to help promote this project.

![Poster mockup](2018sept19a20v7-poster-exported-2018sept24.png)

### Stickers

Stickers could be funded and made. There is a risk that they could become litter or used as vandalism, though, which could harm the project, rather than promote it.

### Embedding (YouTube)

This is no longer necessary with the availability of HTML5 video.

### Linking in comments (YouTube)

This is quite useful, although YouTube actually calls it the "Description" (it's separate from the comments). Providing information and links related to the video allows people who were interested in the video to pursue the project.

## Automatic Vector

How will computers spread your meme?

### IFTTT

This is a tool for constructing simple tasks using Web services' APIs. It does not seem relevant to this project.

## Payload

What's the smallest unit of meaning you hope to circulate?

### App-payload: ________________

The EITE client and server apps are proposed above.

### URL-blog: ________________

This proposal could be polished and published as a Web page. Alternatively or in addition, it should be used to fill out the content in the project's Web site.

### Video: ________________

A video introduction to the project can be created to serve as an aid to recruit other people to work on this.

## Recognition

How will you measure success?

There are two primary success metrics for this semester. One is the progress I make on a prototype and strategy development; another is how many other people I can convince to work on the project with me.

### App downloads/sales

This can be estimated by how it corresponds roughly to the number of people who work on the project with me, which is presumably an upper bound on the number. Some people who want to use the app easily but not worry about developing it (_e.g._ people who find it useful but are working on non-EITE aspects of the project) would use this method of engagement.

### Web site hits

The Web host I am currently using tracks this automatically, but it is of dubious reliability (doesn't indicate how many people are actually interested in working on the project). The number of people who contact and talk to me about it would be a more reliable metric.

### Google Analytics

I don't use this. It's proprietary, it contributes unnecessarily to page CPU and network load, it invades the privacy of people who have used it, and it doesn't measure people with any familiarity with computers, since they would use uBlock Origin or similar software to prevent it loading.

### Google Pagerank

Google Pagerank was discontinued in 2016.

### Money

People with money may become interested in investing it in this project. If so, any contributions and expenditures should be tracked carefully, with the information publicly available to ensure that contributions are used efficiently. Only my personal funds are used at present.

### Credibility (Diggs/Karma)

As an undergraduate student with good grades, I have a moderate but fairly low amount of credibility. My lack of work experience in related fields may affect that as well. (My résumé and the software I have developed are available online, which can help people evaluate my experience, giving me more credibility.)

### Reader comments

People communicating with me to join forces on working on this project is the primary quantifiable metric of success for this semester, I think.

### YouTube views

These are available via YouTube video page. People who contact me are more helpful than people who watch a video but are not interested enough to proceed.

# Computer-free project strategy

Computers are not necessary, central, or even all that relevant to the core goals of this project. They play a role in it as proposed due to how they can simplify, facilitate, and expedite its development, implementation, and use. However, the information technology elements of the proposal could simply be omitted without significant loss or change to the project, and the remainder of the proposal implemented as described (using traditional "paper office" or similar tools for communication, knowledge storage, and management). Taking this further, remote medieval monasteries are perhaps somewhat similar to what this project would look like without any modern technologies, in that they were self-sustaining communities based on a known, adaptable model (and tended towards the preservation of knowledge).

The extensive focus on the information technology aspects in the proposal is largely a product of their impressive capabilities and flexibility, and my personal interest in and frustration with them and their potential, and recognition of the value they could hold for society and this project.

At a minimum, lossless information exporting should be available, with documentation of the format in which it is exported. Google Drive, for instance, does not provide any lossless, documented, supported export format. They offer some supported and documented formats, but they are not lossless (particularly significant is the absence of export of document revision history, despite that history being stored and exposed via the user interface). Some success has been reported with retrieving their native format, but it is not documented, supported, or easily accessible (https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/45562; http://features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs/).

- The practice of "wiping" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiping; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes) historic broadcast media (radio and television) shows is illustrative of popular attitudes towards historical preservation: when value is not recognized at a given moment, things are wantonly neglected or destroyed without regard for what value they may hold in the future. Similarly, many films are lost, especially those that were stored using fragile and flammable nitrocellulose film, in the absence of comprehensive systems in place to ensure their preservation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_preservation; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_film; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrocellulose#Film).

The popular Slack messaging app is designed to capture its users' data, without allowing it to be easily exported: a Slack user cannot export (or even view) all the data they have access to. This prevents people from practically preserving their data stored using Slack. Their business model relies on capturing users' data, and holding it hostage until organizations need it enough to pay them for it.
- Snapchat (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat), like Slack, is a company that predicates its entire business model on the wanton destruction of history: it provides a communications tool that is marketed upon the premise that messages sent with it are forgotten. It is unconscionable that the attitude even exists where anyone would find this acceptable, never mind that it is _widespread_.

<h3>Community: Specification</h3>


<h4>Community</h4>
    <p>An Ember community is a group of individuals who have chosen to create an Ember community, and to live in accordance with shared principles so as to best protect individuals' rights.</p>

<h4>Services collective</h4>
    <p>An Ember community's services collective is a not-for-profit that organizes the procurement and distribution of goods and services for its members, and perhaps those who are not its members as well. The goal of this organization would be to provide any needful things desired by its members for their lives. For instance, if a person chose to receive food through Ember, they could request that it be provided in exchange for labor. Their labor would help contribute to services requested in the future by them or other Ember members. The organization should have 24/7 available buildings staffed by Ember members from whom aid could be sought, such as the furnishing of meals, shelter, clothing, access to information, or other services, in exchange for labor. That way, if an Ember member is in trouble in a strange town, for instance, with no money, identification (beyond their own body), or other resources, they could go to the local Ember building to receive any services they desire; they could even build up credit in preparation for such an incident by working for the Ember collective prior to taking a trip, for instance, so they would have already earned any services they might want.</p>
    <p>People that would be especially benefited by the full form of this project include individuals from marginalized groups, especially those with disabilities, mental illnesses, and the homeless, by enabling them to support themselves through a community and reducing barriers presented to them by discrimination, and by reducing the need for individuals’ dependence on the traditional monetary economy.</p>
<h4>Community and Organization</h4>


<p>Implementation of an Ember community (see <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/specification/community">[http://futuramerlin.com/specification/community]: the relevant section of the specification</a>) has not been attempted due to a lack of resources at present.</p>
<h3>Engineering and Technology</h3>
<h4>Buildings</h4>


<p>A modular building should be designed, which is able to be easily moved even when assembled, changed to add windows or other sections of the building and similar parts, and waterproof.</p>
<h4>Information Technology</h4>
<h5>Hardware</h5>

<h4>Ember Information Technology Environment</h4>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This section of the Ember project specification introduces and documents the Ember computing environment, a project to develop a document-centric computing environment and data format. It is a proposal, design, specification, and (as of now prototype) implementation for an information technology system. The computing environment would be comprised of a centralized append-only information store, a computer operating system user interface integrated with that information store, and related specifications. The computing environment proposed here is distinct from existing technologies in that it attempts to provide superior flexibility by representing all information and documents it uses or processes (including its own software) as strings of text in a Unicode-based character encoding extended for this purpose. This is a work-in-progress draft, and everything here is subject to change and is not presently suited for implementation.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Existing information technology systems have various unnecessary limitations. In addition, many existing information technology systems are not libre software. "Libre" refers to the ethical principle of freedom of knowledge, whereby knowledge is provided with the legal protection of rights such as modification and redistribution. (For specifics on this project's goals and strategies in libre licensing, see the "Licensing" section below.) This results in wasted effort on developing redundant proprietary technologies (for instance, multiple non-interoperable word processing apps), regressions in standards of living caused by the unavailability of proprietary systems (for instance, not being able to use the features of a previous version of a word processing app the more recent versions of which have had some capabilities removed), and the incalculable loss of shared cultural heritage through inconsistent or nonexistent archival practices (and in many cases active hostility towards historical preservation, especially in the interest of short-term personal economic gain) (for instance, the loss of many historic films and television series to neglect or deliberate destruction).</p>
        <p>These problems are not hypothetical. They are very real and ongoing problems, and are actively causing very real and ongoing harm.</p>
        <p>While current computing hardware, and many other processes and aspects of society, have many of the same and similar problems as the problems in software that this subproject aims to address, this section only focuses on software. Other parts of the Ember project deal with computing hardware, industry and industrial designs, and social organization, so these areas are not addressed here.</p>
        <p>Information technology systems are not connected to each other effectively. While standard protocols for some types of data interchange are available, a single integrated IT system for building documents that leverage the full array of diverse types of information that can be represented using IT does not yet exist. In addition, current IT systems do not effectively orient their users and give them a sense of groundedness in regard to what they are doing.</p>

        <h4>Existing work towards solving this problem</h4>
            <p>Many existing projects address various aspects of the issues this project addresses. None seems to cohesively aim to integrate these aspects into a comprehensive libre framework and model implementation, though, driving the need for this project. For an annotated list of related projects and inspirations to this project, see the "Related projects and inspirations" section of the bibliography at the end of this document.</p>

<h2>General approach</h2>
    <p>This project should aim to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of an innovative information technology environment.</p>

    <h3>Current project status</h3>
        <p>"Ember Information Technology Environment" is the current name of this project.</p>
        <p>This project is a part of "Ember", a project to develop and facilitate collaboration on a specification, a library, and a model community, to serve as resources and infrastructure for innovative communities. More information about Ember is available at the Web site for the project, <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/">http://futuramerlin.com/</a>.</p>
        <p>The primary components comprising the project are currently unfinished, but a variety of software maintained to facilitate the development of the project is available.</p>
        <p>A preliminary implementation of the computerized document representation format proposed herein is under development. An interpreter, several format converters, preliminary editing tool, and test suite and runner have been developed so far, as has a demonstration Web browser extension that allows authoring text in Web site text fields using the editing tool and automatically rendering sections of text in the document format embedded in Web pages. Continued work on the interpreter and implementation of the computing environment itself remain.</p>
        <p>The main functional output of the project so far has been the successful development of three well-tested, partially completed software applications that are currently used to facilitate the further development of the project. The first of these is a portable, easy-to-write, transpiled programming language for portable rapid application prototyping being used to develop the prototype implementation. The second of these is a static Web site generator, which is used to build the project's Web site (it includes working features for theming using CSS, with some included themes, automatic blog pagination, and discography Web site generation for musicians). The third of these is a suite of tools for working with file version tracking, document archiving, and data storage and distribution. It is currently in use for storing and managing the more than eleven million files and forty version control repositories used now for this proposal's parent project, as well as the structured archiving of more than eighteen million additional documents outside of the project.</p>

<h2>Intended outcomes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The end goal of this work is the development of a completed, stable software environment used for developing the project, consisting of:
        <ul>
            <li>Specifications</li>
            <li>Information technology environment software implementation</li>
            <li>The cloud computing infrastructure should use a decentralized, asynchronously resolving append-only data store, similar to blockchains, to ensure the preservation and longevity of data stored using it as best as possible.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks list</h2>

    <h3>Planning and strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The most important tasks are also the most difficult. Developing assets (specifications, software, etc.) is trivial compared to developing communication skills and establishing allies. There's a reason there are several usable computer programs developed for this project, but no other people working on it.</li>
            <li>My role in this project should be to coordinate and facilitate until a person or persons more capable is/are available, and/or until it is self-managed, and my presence or absence would have no appreciable effect on it.</li>
        </ul>

< People and communication
- Develop effective communication skills and strategies.
  - That means being able to express clearly, succinctly, and persuasively the following (at least): _what_ this project is, _why_ it is important and achievable, and _how_ to help with it.
  - This includes both in writing and in person. Improving my in-person communication skills is especially important.

## Finances, budget, and stability
- Finances: Develop a financial strategy and budget requirements. As a single, close to broke student without employment or a degree (yet), or a rich family giving me a small loan of a million dollars, I can barely support keeping the lights on for the Web site. (Hosting is somewhere in the US$5/month range. The domain name registration (`futuramerlin.com`) is good through the end of 2022, at which point it will need renewal, which is about US$10/year.) The most recent costs of technical infrastructure is US$106.20 for three years of Web hosting, plus US$83.76 for eight year ownership of domain name. A rough estimate of the cost for the semester of Web hosting is therefore US$17.70, and the cost for the semester of the domain name is US$5.24.
- While the project still has a bus factor of 1, my personal stability is critical for the project. Barring exceptional circumstances, I should be able to continue working on it through graduation thanks to the university and government's student financial aid, and my family's financial support.
- Significant volunteer involvement and/or external investment will be necessary for a full implementation of this project.

### Detailed budget estimates

## Steps dependent on interpersonal connections
- Establish the physical community. This will require initial capital of *at least* tens of thousands of US dollars, as well as support for ongoing expenses.
- Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project
- Ensure that organization's financial stability (through sources such as an endowment and grants)
- Transfer control of the project's assets (Web presence, etc.) to that organization

        <p>The computing environment will consist of the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Development principles, describing the process to use for creating the computing environment</li>
            <li>Data format and its representations
                <ul>
                    <li>Specification</li>
                    <li>Reference implementation</li>

            <li>Data storage system and infrastructure: mechanism for storing append-only set of records, each comprising a unique ID paired with a node document</li>
            <li>Software system, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Client component</li>
                <li>Server components, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Public-facing API</li>
                        <li>Search engine</li>
                        <li>Storage backend</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Premise</h3>
        <p>Current computerized information technology systems do not live up to their potential. By developing tools to allow blending media types together, new opportunities arise in the use of information technology systems, including in structured data and the arts. An append-only decentralized archive of a community’s knowledge gives many advantages in usability, accessibility, and preservation.</p>
    <h3>Goals of the project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposing, prototyping, and developing a new form of computerized information technology system</li>
            <li>Basing that system on the potential of such systems, rather than mimicing the roles and restrictions of analog media</li>
            <li>Part of a project to develop tools and resources to make it easier to experiment with changes to society and technology in local communities</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
        <p>Current computerized information technology systems do not fully explore and use the potential of the medium. Many popular computerized information technology systems are too complicated to understand well (this applies to hardware, too). Many popular computerized information technology systems cannot be relied on or trusted. Knowledge is not systematically protected for historical preservation. Current structured knowledge databases are unable to hold any types of information they are wanted to, as databases are restricted to an artificial subset of documents considered to be “text”. Current systems often are not easily flexible and customizable for end users.</p>
    <h3>Project strategies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Treating all media as sequences of units analogous to characters in text</li>
            <li>Allowing all types of media to coexist in a document, and avoiding restrictions on what can go where in a document</li>
            <li>Trying to ensure easy portability of software</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Current status</h3>
        <p>The most practical product of this work is a transpiled programming language that can be easily converted to other languages. That way, you can write a program in one language, and have it run in many. A prototype document format interpreter is available, demonstrating unit-oriented document representation. A software library is available that provides APIs for running, importing, transforming, and exporting documents using this representation, and for data storage and Web interface access control. Documents can be exported as Unicode text, with non-Unicode contents stored using the Unicode private use area. A Web browser extension is available that can display text in Web pages represented using those Unicode extensions as the original document. A graphical tool for editing documents stored using this unit-oriented document representation is available, intended to facilitate the implementation of the next stages of the project. Documentation of the prototype is available, as is this document discussing the project.</p>
    <h3>Future goals and plans</h3>
        <p>This should serve as a demonstration of the potential of this type of information technology system. It should be extended to be usable as a practical computing environment. Unit-centric document representation allows structured data to represent information that is not supported by current database systems, and presents new opportunities for electronic media artists. As a computing environment, an append-only distributed data store should be provided, so that a community can use a network of computers running this software to share and track a shared machine-readable knowledge base of the community’s history and knowledge.</p>
        <p>All interactions with the computing environment should be continually recorded in the knowledge base, so that any computer in the network always has its data backed up, and (by using an append-only data store) be able to return to any previous state. All interactions with a computer could be recorded in real time, so that whenever you want you could see a previous state of your computer, so that you wouldn't have to wonder exactly how you got from point A to point B when working on a project; if you go back to it years later and wonder what you were thinking, you could actually see what you did as you were creating it. The user interface of the computing environment should be implemented using the same unit-oriented document format as the rest of the system, allowing it to be customized as desired to ensure it can serve each person in the manner they prefer.</p>
        <p>Having a community’s knowledge and history stored as structured, machine-readable data allows additional flexibility:
        <ul>
            <li>It can allow people to configure how they want to see information (such as ensuring the text size is always large enough).</li>
            <li>It can allow people to configure what information they want to be given (for instance, filtering out documents that have not been screened for being dangerous to people with photosensitive epilepsy).</li>
            <li>It ensures all knowledge in the system is preserved for future history.</li>
            <li>It can allow people to keep their information private, rather than having it slurped up for advertising.</li>
            <li>It can allow people to access, copy, back up, and conduct research using the information easily, rather than knowledge being locked up in commercial databases.</li>
        </ul></p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Current computerized information technology systems do not live up to their full potential. So, by developing tools to allow combining media types together, new opportunities arise in the use of information technology systems, including in structured data, the arts, and an append-only decentralized archive of a community's knowledge, giving many advantages in usability, accessibility, and preservation.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Using the ebuild to install the software through Portage is suggested. Simple installation (untested) in case Portage or the ebuild is not suitable for your system: <code>git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-information-technology-environment; cd ember-information-technology-environment; make autodep; ./configure; make; sudo make install</code>. <code>curl</code> must be available already.</p>
    <p>If you just build EITE without installing it, the built software will be placed in the "built/" folder. The structure of that folder corresponds to the /usr/share/eite/ folder when the software is installed. This is what is meant by the "EITE installation root" in this documentation.</p>

<h2>Development principles</h2>
<!-- These are the principles the project is intended to follow. I did not follow them during this capstone project, because they do not prioritize creating working prototype software for demonstration, and instead prioritize creating reliable software that aligns with documentation and specification. Consequently, the code in its state at the end of the capstone has a range of capabilities, but is quite unreliable and poorly documented. Future work should adhere to these principles closely to get the software to work well again. -->
    <ul>
        <li>Never remove a feature, capability, or option. If the development of an improved architecture or addition of new features involves scrapping existing code, reintroduce all previously existing capabilities before releasing the changes to the software.</li>
        <li>Make sure that all tests pass when releasing changes to the software.</li>
        <li>Thorough automated unit tests should be provided and kept passing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prerequisites for code to be added to the repository</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Code must be readable and documented.</li>
            <li>Code must not cause or have failing tests.</li>
            <li>Code should include thorough automatic test coverage.</li>
            <li>To keep the software in line with the specification, code must address a deviation from the current specification (bug, missing feature, <span class="foreign-text">etc.</span>), and may not contain code unrelated to that.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>How issues should be prioritized</h3>
        <p>Ordered from highest priority to lowest priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Potential for data loss</li>
            <li>Security vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>Functional regressions</li>
            <li>Incorrect results</li>
            <li>Crashes, lack of accessibility/internationalization, and similar critical usability issues</li>
            <li>Slow code with a significant impact on usability</li>
            <li>Aesthetic regressions</li>
            <li>Minor usability issues</li>
            <li>Slow code with a moderate impact on usability</li>
            <li>Missing features</li>
        </ol>

<h2>Design goals</h2>
    <p>This section proposes developing an information technology system that allows various types of data to be given a first-class role. The proposed system is a centralized but non-centralization-dependent append-only information store, a computer operating system integrated with that information store, and related specifications.</p>
    <p>Web-based information technology companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook have a disproportionately large amount of power, have a disproportionately large role in how individuals are able to conduct their daily lives, and are single points of failure for a large portion of the modern lifestyle. These corporations are private institutions with little to no public oversight and control, despite having a large and visible role (perhaps even larger than any one government) in individuals’ lives. To begin to challenge that power structure, this semi-decentralized document-oriented computing platform should be developed that can integrate the abilities of traditional information technology systems into a single, cohesive system. Such a system should be free/libre software, and should be designed in such a way that it can adapt when needed to functioning as a fully decentralized, serverless system, transparently adjusting to the networking capabilities or lack thereof available to it on an ad-hoc basis. The existence of this project as a replacement would prevent single IT companies’ systems being single points of failure, and its distributed model would prevent it itself from being a single point of failure. Additionally, by being fully free/libre software, and by using a single system and data format for the full range of services, this proposal would reduce the dangers created by vendor lock-in, proprietary products, and incompatible IT systems.</p>
    <p>An important basic principle of EITE is flexibility. It should allow the user do what they want in an elegant manner, without undue shenanigans, difficult workarounds, or unwanted assistance. It should accommodate various workflows, and be thoroughly customizable. Its default configuration should be simple and easy to use. User interfaces should abstract away technical complexities by default while remaining fully usable, while allowing access to those complexities if desired.</p>
    <p>The system should use a single, libre, fully specified data format to store all types of information it processes, and development of the system should strive to ensure that a thorough selection of capabilities are provided out of the box using a consistent and customizable user interface, obviating the need for external apps (which often tend to be inconsistent in things such as internationalization and accessibility). The use of a single data format would allow, for instance, text, structured data, sound, and interactive media such as computer games to all be practically equivalent to each other, such that wherever one could be used, another could be used instead, ensuring thorough flexibility. This will prevent frustration of users when they are unable to combine disparate types of data into a single logical document, as would be their reasonable expectation. To make a system that is effective and useful, it should provide an interface, described here, to orient users and give them a guided workflow based on the information the IT system knows regarding them to help them get what they need to do done. (External apps should be possible to use, for instance as references to facilitate developing libre alternatives, as well as to provide historical access and allow verifying that libre alternatives are actually equivalent, but while they should be possible to use, they should never be <em>necessary</em> to use.)</p>
    <p>For instance, there is no technical reason that italicized text can not be used in email subject lines, or for that matter, that an entire computer game could not be used as someone's email address. These restrictions are arbitrary and frustrating to people trying to work around them, and this computer system should resolve that by considering all types of information to be stored as simple strings of tokens, similar to current character encodings.</p>
    <p>The data format used should provide mechanisms for storing the meanings of text, so that text in one language can be marked up in a manner that allows it to be machine-read without the ambiguities of a natural lanugage, and a facility provided for exporting that annotated text to various languages in the same manner that content can be exported to various data formats. This could make it easier to localize documents, by providing a way to tell the computer what text means and let it produce translations, without having to translate it to other languages by hand.</p>
    <p>Developing an information technology system that integrates diverse types of data would improve efficiency and reduce frustration from unexpected, artificial limitations within computer systems for nearly any user of information technology systems. The number of personal computers was estimated to be “0.17 computers per person worldwide” in 2015 [Statista, n.d.]. 3.58 billion people are estimated to use the Internet [Statista, n.d. (b)]. This represents an enormous amount of people who use information technology systems, and it is likely that the majority of these would benefit from this proposal, especially those who work often with multimedia.</p>
    <p>Another goal of this work is to create an information technology system that will help guide people with dementia and other mental disabilities. The WHO estimates that 47 million people have dementia. [WHO 2017] Another group of people who would likely find such tools useful is those with autism-spectrum learning disabilities. Entire worldwide population statistics for autism-spectrum disorders are not accurately known [Miller-Wilson, n.d.], but according to the WHO [WHO 2017b], estimated 1 in 160 children worldwide have autism-spectrum disorders, and according to the NIH [NIH, n.d.], estimated 1 in 68 within the United States. Finally, ordinary computer users would likely be able to benefit somewhat from the same systems, simply because while optimally designed tools may provide the greatest amount of benefit to those with challenges that affect their ability to use current systems, such tools would likely help everyone to some extent.</p>
    <p>Because there are so many people affected by these challenges, and many others would likely benefit as well, there is a large group of people who would potentially find the proposed tools helpful. Consequently, working towards developing such a system is a valuable and important goal. The large potential benefit that could be gained from having such a system could, even if the individual increase in productivity were relatively small, have a substantial impact on the overall ability of humans to be productive and educated. In addition, a smaller group of people who are less able to use current information technology systems would probably see even larger gains in their productivity.</p>

<h2>Further principles</h2>
    <p>One of the fundamental elements of the information technology environment would be the creation of a cloud-based information technology system, intended to provide effective and efficient information storage and retrieval (ISR). This would likely use an append-only NoSQL database to store a softly directed concept graph. Most or all knowledge can be effectively represented using two basic structures: nodes and relationships. Relationships would be specific types of nodes. Each node would correspond to a document stored as a sequence of character-like digital identifiers ("Dcs") analogous to both characters in a computer character encoding and to assembly language opcodes, allowing all types of electronic data to be stored as strings. These strings would be able to hold any structured data through the use of specific Dcs, such that when a document was added to the ISR system, it could be indexed deterministically into a separate database which would cache the structured information extracted from that document.</p>
    <p>The nodes of a graph are the individual records that it stores. Relationships between those nodes are the edges of the graph, although it is possible that the system being developed will provide for more complex relationships, for example by allowing relationships to connect several nodes to each other in a variety of ways, although whether that proves necessary or useful remains to be seen. Metadata are an item’s traits: information such as the title of a node, or a description of it. The way the system is designed, placing all three of these types of entity into one table, allows relationships and metadata to have the attributes of nodes: for example, metadata could be attached to a relationship or another metadatum, or relationships could be specified that connect any combination of the three. There are many existing ISR systems, such as flat files and flat searching, flat-search filterable record sets, sorted records, a variety of tree and tree-like structures, tagged or labeled records, traditional tabular databases, relational databases, sparse tables, sparse matrices and entity-attribute-value models, graphs and digraphs, Boolean-queriable datasets, hierarchies, automated natural-language document acquisition and indexing, metadata-enriched natural-language document acquisition and indexing, and selective-display intelligent query results. The system proposed here would primarily leverage a graph structure augmented through the use of richly labeled nodes, providing great flexibility in the structures it can manage; in addition, the above structures could be emulated within a graph-driven environment for when they are preferred.</p>
    <p>This will also provide effective options for implementing the wide variety of existing ISR systems outlined above as both self-hosted applications executed both in the cloud and in userspace.</p>
    <p>There are a variety of content sources that would populate this ISR system: publicly available datasets, creative works, and other resources; resources added and/or created by individuals using the system; “dark” content such as is currently held by social networks, governments, and other organizations that do not publicly release their records; moderated content that has been reviewed and fact-checked and annotated as such by the Ember project NGO for supporting the model community; dynamically generated content; and computed content, for example, the results from a mathematical calculation or an operation on a dataset.</p>
    <p>This ISR system should be leveraged by the NGO for several purposes. First, it can be used to record the individuals who are participants in the NGO. Through the development and application of a biometrics system, perhaps similar to that of India’s Aadhaar program, the use of names could be easily foregone, allowing for people who are mononymous, change their name frequently, have unconventional names, have no name, and so on and so forth to easily use the system, without being subjected to the usual tribulations that accompany any of the above in many modern governments. (It would also eliminate similar gender identity and other issues in receiving government services.) While instability of identification traits in individuals, either through subversion of the system or through chance, is indeed a concern, both for positive and negative identification (Sahoo, Choubisa, and Prasanna: “Multimodal Biometric Person Authentication: A Review”. 2012. In <em>IETE Technical Review</em>, vol. 29 issue 1, January–February 2012), hopefully a sufficiently deep set of metrics could be established to prevent this from being an issue. When an individual becomes part of the NGO, they would be enrolled in the biometric identification system, and provided a system for communication and tracking of some type. This could take several forms: the most practical and useful, probably, would be a wristwatch-like interface to cloud computing systems that would contain a GPS system and other useful electronics. The purpose of this would be the providing of emergency services: in the event of an emergency, the wearer could interact in it in a way to convey the existence and, if possible, the nature and situation of an emergency. This information would be entered automatically into the ISR system, which would provide a report of the emergency, including the person’s location, their direction and speed of travel, any known health conditions, their current health state (heart rate, blood pressure, and such). The system could automatically delegate the emergency to a nearby station of the NGO, which would act (presumably with the assistance of emergency response services) to resolve the situation.</p>
    <p>Education and qualifications could be tracked through this system, as could taxes. For example, when a person completed testing by the organisation in a given subject, that score could be recorded in their profile in such a way that it could be used to determine what jobs they are allowed to work at. Taxation should be managed through time, so that a person would put in a certain number of hours of work selected from the jobs that need doing according to the ISR’s task record tracking system (possibly the number of hours necessary for a given amount of the organization’s services provided would be related to the level of qualification necessary for the work in question) to receive the organisation’s services in exchange. The person could choose which services to allocate their time credits to — for example, requesting food credits, requesting tickets to operas, or donating them to charity. In such a way, the taxes levied would hopefully never have to be put to a use the individual considered unethical. Inter-personal trading could also be facilitated through the ISR system. Such an information technology system to manage and facilitate work by individuals, tracking what needs to be done and what skills people have, and offering jobs to people with the relevant skills, would allow the individuals to bypass the difficult job search and application process, which uses a lot of individuals’ time and energy without producing any real value from that expenditure. Then, when a job is completed, the person who did the work would be granted credits corresponding to the work they did, which could then be exchanged for goods or services. This type of system could be implemented as a single, centralized system. However, it could also be implemented as a decentralized system.</p>
    <p>To decentralize such a system, individual computers that make up the information technology system would have to be able to negotiate information sharing between other computers that are accessible via network. While implementing decentralization of the storage architecture, the API is in place, and once the separate OrbitDB project (<a href="https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db">https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db</a>) is more stable, it looks like it would provide an effective and practical basis for an implementation of this. If each individual computer has the entire capability to maintain the system, then the network would be able to split and recombine as needed depending on situation.</p>
    <p>For instance, two geographically remote implementations of this system would be able to be connected when a network connection between them was available, being able to share work assignments remotely, but if a storm or other situation disrupted the network connection, the two communities’ economies would split into separate economies and continue working independently seamlessly, and then recombine when the network connection returned. In such a system, each individual who has a computer thus has access to and control over that part of the economy. This still leaves one centralized aspect, though, which is the software controlling the economies. If it is community-maintained libre software, that problem is largely eliminated, aside from the usual problems of project governance. If it is preferred, the software could also have facilities for creating ad-hoc centralization, where one instance of the software within each group of instances accessible within a given network would adopt the role of leader. This could be decided automatically, and made fully invisible to users of the system, or through community selection with automatic selection as a fallback, which would probably be preferable so as to ensure that systems with good connectivity and uptime (such as servers in datacenters) were selected as leaders, avoiding unnecessary inefficiency and maximizing reliability.</p>
    <p>Thorough user group and subgroup support should be provided. This would be especially useful for facilitating collaboration between individuals, such as in business use of the software.</p>
    <h3>Target solution spaces</h3>
        <p>In summary, any current uses for software above the operating system level are reasonable areas to attempt development. An outline list of some <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/target-solution-spaces-list.htm">[http://futuramerlin.com/target-solution-spaces-list.htm]: is available</a>. (Operating system development and hypothetical software use cases outside of exploration of the possibilities introduced by the novel information representation method may be of interest but are not priorities for this project at this time.)</p>
    <h3>Semantic representation</h3>
        <p>There are two principle structural levels for which elements need to be described: documents and texts. A document is a complete unit such as a book or journal article, which would comprise various textual regions (note that in typesetting some items, such as database records of titles or filenames, only one textual region would be used; in the first, either a "Document Title" or a "Standard" region type would be used, depending on how the database was being queried, that is, the presentation style of the information as a title or as standard text (such as if it were being displayed in a page that contained a list of database fields), and in the second, a "Standard" region type would be used for interface display in lists (other region types might be used at other times) (note that in any use cases when it is in a "Standard" textual region, it would still have the text type Title)). A textual region is a section of content that has one semantic componency, _e.g._ the body of a document or the title; a document is therefore comprised of texts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Liberal relationship formation and node typing: A node can be assigned any other node as its type; a relationship can be from any type of node to any other type of node even if that is not how the relationship is defined (this situation could display a warning, for example).</li>
            <li>Authority contexts: Information should be able to be tagged with information on its authority. When used at the node level, as opposed to within document content, authority context information should be validated to ensure the utility of the available nodes (so that the authority context tagging can be used to evaluate the reliability of a given document). For instance, objective consensus, reflecting a neutral point of view, not necessarily trying to represent all points of view equally because of lack of consensus about them, versus subjective individual/organization source, representing an individual or organization's opinion, without necessarily any regard for a neutral point of view, such as in opinion writing or advertising.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A node is a document, represented as a sequence of Dcs, stored in the EITE system. A document created by an individual would presumably, when stored as a node, have additional information not managed by the individual, such as who has the right to read and edit it. Thus, the document an individual would work with would be stored as a portion of a larger document representing its corresponding node. Because the system is append-only, nodes would have revisions, representing each time it was changed. For letter-by-letter changes, produced while typing without saving, instead of saving a new revision, letter-by-letter change tracking and storage could be used, such as is used by Etherpad.</p>
        <p>Various fully featured ways to interact with the system should be provided. For instance, a graphical interface, a command-line interface, and a UNIX-style "everything is a file" interface. (Filesystems, especially APIs exposed as filesystem entities have their own challenges and risks, such as confusing scripts that aren't designed to work with anything except plain old files, having unusual structures such as files not present in any directory, infinite directory trees resulting from hardlinks to directories, files with multiple forks, or named pipes, and if providing nodes by filename, having files and directories with the same names or directories with a data fork; these issues will need work and research to resolve well and provide good user experiences.)</p>
        <h4>Complex Dc sequences, Sequence Builders, and Dynamic Sets</h4>
            <p>A complex sequence of Dcs could be built using special-purpose input tools for constructing them. For instance, purpose-built tools could be provided for constructing a sequence of Dcs representing a mathematical equation, or a sequence of Dcs representing a given time or color.</p>
            <p>Similarly, a special type of sequence builder could be used to build sets of values. For instance, for selecting a document to send to someone, a document set builder dialog could be provided. It would allow selecting one or more documents to send manually, or selecting one or more documents by specifying rules for their selection. Then, the set containing the chosen node or nodes (optionally, at their present revision) is saved as a node; that set node is then provided to the person one is communicating to; the same interface could be used for selecting files for working with in an app. Sets could have restrictions, such as regarding how many documents they could contain, whether they could contain complex structures (such as a directory tree), whether one document could be swapped out with another or not, or whether the set should automatically gather new nodes matching the specified rules. Sets could also be driven by search criteria (_e.g._ the most relevant 10 nodes for a given keyword or given Boolean search conditions, or all four nodes with type Musician and a "is member of" relationship to "The Beatles", or the rapidly changing set of nodes with type Musician and a current or past "is member of" relationship to "Yes"), or built programmatically from new or existing nodes. Sets could also hold non-node strings. (Node IDs, as with everything else, can be considered as special cases of strings.) This would allow file uploads, searches, etc. to all be driven using the same basic user interface module, which would essentially be an extension of traditional file pickers. The set node would have a Dc sequence representation, as do all nodes, so this is really a Dc sequence builder. Like anything else in EITE, by virtue of being an append-only system, a set could "time travel": a set could display its contents as they would be at any past time. Another application of the set builder could be creating a document that displayed the current top 10 tracks on the Billboard Hot 100 — a set could be created representing the top 10, and a rule could be created if desired to deal with the condition if the Hot 100 was discontinued: the set could be configured to return nothing, to return a fixed list, to return the top 10 from the final edition of the charts, _et cetera_. A set builder could also be used to select dynamic and non-finite groups of things, such as the set of all integers, or all strings matching a given language syntax; this ability would be similar to the lazy evaluation used frequently in functional programming.</p>
    <h3>Implementation challenges and strategy</h3>
        <p>An implementation of a simple state-machine–driven interpreter of the token-based document format specification for the information technology environment aspect of the project is planned. There have been several previous attempts at developing this, but they have not worked out for various reasons. The first implementation was in PHP, and had poor architecture and rather unmaintainable code. A second attempt in Java was excessively ambitious in attempting to parse a programming-language-style document format interactively, without any specification and only minimal planning or architecture, as well as being highly overengineered. An attempt in PHP and JQuery to build a user interface toolkit based on these principles crashed and burned due to poor code architecture and attempting to “put the cart before the horse” in developing a UI toolkit without any specification for it, and without consideration of the existing (specified) aspects of the format. A fresh attempt in PHP stalled due to also being rather unmaintainable and awkwardly written, specifically in its use of dynamically written JavaScript, and trouble storing arbitrary binary content, independent of character encoding, in HTML text boxes (which are really the wrong tool for the job). An implementation in Bash was considered and a command-line interface designed for it, but probably this will simply become a wrapper around the JavaScript implementation. The JavaScript implementation here will attempt to avoid these issues by only implementing what has already been specified, not attempting to handle the programming-language-style format yet, using extensive unit tests (which was very helpful in the Java implementation), and using modularized code (which has been helpful in successful projects undertaken in the interim), and by planning the architecture of the code (shown in the diagram below) before implementing it. A staging language has been implemented in JavaScript to allow the code written for the project to be trivially portable to other platforms and languages.</p>
        <p>What I have been able to develop, practically speaking, is simply a technology demo and beginning of an implementation of a tool with larger scope. Consequently, it is rather limited in its practical utility, making it not suitable for a general audience, and mainly useful as a tool for demonstrating some of the principles used in this project, and as a core starting-point for the implementation of a more substantial and practically useful set of capabilities. StageL and the StageL-implemented library developed so far provide a solid technological foundation for further implementation of this project, and have practical applications outside of it as well.</p>
    <h3>Decentralized networked systems: Ad-hoc Computer Network Negotiation</h3>
        <p>This project should incorporate ad-hoc computer network negotiation to ensure effective and practical decentralized operation.</p>
        <p>Ad-hoc computer network negotiation is an emerging technology that holds significant promise for facilitating access to information and communication services in situations where traditional centralized Internet connectivity is limited or unavailable, such as in rural areas, during natural disasters, in war zones, and in other situations where traditional centralized Internet connectivity is limited or unavailable. The premise of the technology is to find ways to allow electronic equipment to communicate and establish connections to one another without depending on a central authority or centrally maintained resources such as an Internet service provider, commercially operated cables, or a name authority service. The technology allows electronic equipment to communicate and establish connections to one another without depending on a central authority or centrally maintained resources. There are some technical barriers to achieving the full potential of this technology, but various developments are leading towards its more widespread adoption.</p>
        <p>Research into ad-hoc computer network negotiation is ongoing, and implementing this widely, effectively, and practically is a difficult problem. In an ad-hoc computer network, individuals’ privately owned, portable equipment could perform all the necessary routing to establish a connection to any other node of the network.</p>
        <p>There are several pieces that must come together to effect such a technology.</p>
        <p>Consensus upon a standardized protocol for wirelessly establishing a decentralized network has not yet been fully established. Getting this consensus is largely a social and usage-dependent problem (the “network effect” creates something of a chicken-and-egg problem hindering the establishment of this). On the other hand, communication protocols to enable networking is a solved problem: the protocols which underlie Internet communication, UDP, TCP, and IP, are distributed already, which is what allows intranets and other independent, non-Internet-connected networks to communicate in an Internet-like fashion. The protocols are the same, but the independent networks are not connected to the specific instances of centralized trust systems that are a defining part of the Internet.</p>
        <p>Because fully distributed systems are inherently somewhat limited in their capabilities, due to the lack of a common trust system, this is not a technology that would entirely decentralize the Internet. Rather, it would provide a means for the system to continue operating in the event of losses of centralized service, and it would simplify replacing those few services which by nature must be centralized if an independent, separate network chose to implement them (a distributed centralization, in a sense, as it enables the centralized parts to be forked or replaced and to have their roles filled by equivalent but separate instances).</p>
        <p>One missing part of the technology is integrated relays for connectivity: if one piece of equipment can see another, and that one can in turn connect to the public Internet, there is no standardized protocol to enable the latter to route traffic on behalf of the former, and most common equipment does not provide the hardware necessary for such a facility. A protocol with a similar purpose has been implemented by ZigBee-brand communication hardware, which provides communication facilities for Internet of Things equipment, but it has a different purpose; even so it demonstrates the feasibility of the concept.</p>
        <p>A technology known as content-addressed storage systems enables the unambiguous identification of, and thereby discussion of, information, without the need to quote it in its entirety: whereas traditional citation formats (e.g. an author’s name and a title, or a Web URL) do not include enough information to verify that the cited document being viewed by a reader is the same as the document viewed by the author, by including a cryptographic hash, the content can be identified precisely. Brewster Kahle, quoting Peter Lyman, writes: “Now we can add something: ‘Content addressibility means that knowledge has a name.’” This is the system used by the Git distributed version control system, and it allows validation of the accuracy of a copy of a document or set of documents, and thereby validation of the authenticity of them as well through the use of cryptographic signatures.

        </p>
        <p>The ability to locate and establish a connection to a specific network node given only its name and a connection to other nodes in the network, without centralization being needed, is demonstrated by distributed hash trackers (DHT). DHT is a content-addressed storage system using which, given a network connection, can return — given the cryptographic hash of desired information — the address of a computer containing the information corresponding to that hash, without any centralized authority. Similarly, an experimental system called Namecoin attempts to implement a decentralized alternative to the Internet’s Domain Name System using a similar technique.</p>
        <p>As with the Internet, verification of the identity of the connection thereby established can be accomplished using public-key cryptography, given an existing centralized public key infrastructure (PKI).

            </figure>
        Public key cryptography is a technology allowing messages to be sent securely to a person without first having a secure communication channel to exchange secret cryptographic keys. Simon Singh summarized the challenge posed by key sharing between geographically separated parties in traditional cryptography in The Code Book: “If two parties wanted to communicate securely, they had to rely on a third party to deliver the key, and this became the weakest link in the chain of security.” This challenge was overcome by developments in cryptography in the 1970s, allowing a public key infrastructure to be developed for the Internet. The PKI is one of the aspects of the Internet that cannot be effectively decentralized, due to the challenge of knowing whether a public key belongs to the network node it is purported to without any source of trusted information transfer from which to bootstrap trust of the given node.</p>
        <p>These other implementations show that many of the hard problems that obstruct and have historically prevented developing ad-hoc computer network negotiation have already been partially or fully solved by other technologies. This indicates that effective development and adoption of this technology is possible.</p>
        <p>The primary challenge remaining is not technical, but socioeconomic: an existing base of electronic equipment using a common protocol for distributed network routing is needed for any one piece of equipment with this capability to show substantial benefit to its owner, and individuals are unlikely to invest in the additional cost of the equipment necessary for this capability without knowing that they will be able to use it. This chicken-and-egg problem can be solved, however, in several means.</p>
        <p>The most likely solution is that one or more large equipment manufacturers will see the potential benefit of the technology and implement it in their products despite the additional cost. If it is provided and made available with new equipment when it is purchased, its benefits would be felt at least in part by consumers, driving other manufacturers to adopt it. Another possible solution for this issue is that governments, businesses, nonprofits, or other organizations will develop and produce equipment implementing this technology and use it for their work, and that this would provide the seed needed for its adoption.</p>
        <p>In any regard, this technology has huge potential benefits, because of the access to information it can provide: this facilitates, makes more effective, and democratizes access to emergency response and safety, business work in areas without established infrastructure, personal access to education and communication technologies, military operations, and the many other benefits afforded by access to the Internet.</p>
    <h3>The project in the context of new media studies: Alignment of the project approach to the traits of the currently emerging new media</h3>
        <p>Henry Jenkins's article "Eight Traits of the New Media Landscape" (http://nmdprojects.net/teaching_resources/jenkins_eight_traits_of_new_media.pdf) provides eight traits that its author observes in the prominent currently emerging new media. This section of the proposal evaluates this project's expression of this set of traits.</p>
        <p>The first of these traits is <em>innovation</em>. This project proposal is arguably merely an extension and refinement of existing systems, and so may not be considered true innovation, depending on perspective. Even in that case, however, because those existing systems are themselves innovative, this project remains a work within new media, even if it is not itself a new medium.</p>
        <p>The second trait is <em>convergence</em>. This proposal is highly convergent, being a broadly scoped project to innovate across a wide range of technology applications. It is intended to inherit the capabilities of existing computers, which are used for text, sound, image, video, and interactive media, among others.</p>
        <p>The third defining trait is <em>everyday</em> presence. As a project to develop a unified system providing all necessary technology infrastructure, if it is successfully completed and used to its envisioned potential, it would be able to serve as the framework for people's everyday lives. When only available in partial form, those portions of it can be used in everyday settings as well (<em>e.g.</em> large chunks of my classwork and other data I rely on and use on an everyday basis (personal projects, music library, email, etc.) are stored and managed using software developed in the course of developing this project).</p>
        <p>The fourth trait is <em>appropriation</em>. This proposed project ideally will be highly appropriative, because so much work has already been done. It would in all probability be hugely wasteful and impractical to attempt to build everything from scratch, rather than to leverage existing systems (even if only practical through inspiration!) and merely work to fill gaps and integrate the various existing technologies well. That said, reliance on proprietary or externally managed technologies should be eliminated as soon as practical, with all elements of the project and its dependencies being fully libre, because proprietary, non-maintainable, and trade-dependent systems are brittle and are a huge threat to the ability of human society to maintain its standards of living over time. Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.</p>
        <p>The fifth trait is <em>networkedness</em>. As a design goal for this project, networking should be provided when available, but never mandatory. Systems that depend entirely on networking are, echoing the discussion of the fourth point, brittle. A cloud computing–backed virtual digital assistant, for instance, is thoroughly useless in the event of networking being unavailable. Once constructed, the best tools would be fully usable in a vacuum.</p>
        <p>The sixth trait is being <em>global</em>. The proposed project is intended to be able to be geographically dispersed.</p>
        <p>The seventh trait is <em>generational</em>. Whether an age gap will affect this project is hard to predict. If it does, it should only be by the choice of individuals, rather than by inaccessibility or prejudice: if people who are a different age than the majority involved in the project, those people should be provided any necessary accommodations to the fullest extent possible (medical care for the elderly, education for the young, and so on). This project should not engage in discrimination based on age, although it could only serve adults until a sufficient child protection framework is in place (<em>e.g.</em> I think Google doesn't allow kids to use it, so this presumably shouldn't either).</p>
        <p>The eighth trait is <em>inequality</em>. Unfortunately, this likely may affect the project initially, particularly due to economic barriers to access to information technology systems. Working to reduce undesired inequality as much as possible should be a design goal of the project, while promoting diversity and freedom.</p>

<h2>StageL</h2>
    <p>A simple programming language is provided for easily writing portable algorithms to be transpiled to and used by programs in other languages. It is the language in which the implementation of the Dc-based document format is implemented. See <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/stagel.htm">[http://futuramerlin.com/stagel.htm]: its documentation page</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Implementation process flow</h2>
    <p>This diagram shows conceptually how data flows at a high level in the process of running an EITE document using an interpreter (a compile-then-run system would use different data flows, but the overall effect would be equivalent). The non-bracketed elements represent programmed processes. The bracketed elements represent data structures. A circle ○ represents data storage persists for the lifetime of the document being open or being executed (not necessarily in RAM: for a long-running background task, like a periodic mail fetcher, this data could be moved to disk or the cloud if useful to free up local memory). Other data structures can be buffered/streaming FIFOs that discard input as it becomes unneccesary. The arrows represent data flows into and out of data storage or the system. This diagram assumes a Dc sequence as input; other forms of input would need a separate conversion/interpretation step for this.</p>

    <h3>EITE Language</h3>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p>Develop a machine-readable language that can be used as an equivalent representation of documents represented as sequences of Dcs, for easier reading and editing by humans (using an ordinary text editor and conversion tool). It should also be able to be implemented using and transpiled into StageL.</p>
        <h4>Language profiles</h4>
            <p>EITE Language programs may optionally declare a non-default language profile to use: Core, Basic, and Dangerous (the default is "Standard"). Core and Basic both restrict the program to a subset of the language. The Basic language interpreter is written using the Core subset of the language, and provides useful shortcuts to use in the development of the interpreter for the Standard profile. The Default language interpreter is written using the Basic subset of the language, which will correspond to StageL. The Dangerous profile allows using language features which are probably a bad idea to use, but may be needed in some cases.</p>
        <h4>Dcs</h4>
            <p>The core unit of the EITE Language is the Dc (Document Component<!-- The name comes from "DCE Character", but is redefined for this context. -->). The defined Dcs are listed in DcData.csv. An EITE Language document is a list of Dcs, and a file is considered <em>structurally valid</em> if it can be interpreted as such. A Dc can have a syntactical pattern that it can require if it is to be meaningful. For example, a marker to <em>begin</em> a section of a document might be required to have a matching <em>end</em> marker. A document is only <em>syntactically valid</em> if the usage of each Dc contained within it conforms to the Dc's defined syntax, even if the document is otherwise structurally valid.</p>
            <h5>Reading DcData.csv</h5>
                <p>DcData.csv contains nine columns, each of which gives some information about a given Dc.</p>
                <p>From left to right, the columns are: ID, Name, Combining class, Bidirectional class, Simple case mapping, Type, Script, Details, and Description.</p>
                <p>The "ID" column specifies the number used to refer to a given Dc. Once an ID has been specified in a stable version, its meaning will not change in future versions.</p>
                <p>The "Name" column specifies an informative name for the Dc. The names may change in future versions if the current names seem suboptimal. They should not be relied on as unique or stable identifiers. If a name is prefixed with "!", then that Dc is deprecated. Names <em>should</em> be unique within any given version of DcData.csv, although errors in it could compromise that (it is not currently checked by a computer).</p>
                <p>"Combining class" column: See below.</p>
                <p>"Bidirectional class" column: See below.</p>
                <p>"Simple case mapping" column: This column contains the ID of the uppercase form of characters with the "Ll" type, and the ID of the lowercase form of characters with the "Lu" type.</p>
                <p>"Type" column: See below.</p>
                <p>The "Script" column indicates the script or other set to which the character belongs. Values needing further explanation include "Semantic", "DCE", "DCE sheets", "Noncharacters", "DCE versions", "Encapsulation", "EL Syntax", "EL Routines", and "EL Types".</p>
                <p>The "Details" column contains various additional information about characters, as a comma-separated list.
                    <ul>
                        <li>List entries beginning with "&gt;" are cross-references to related Dcs. List entries beginning with "&lt;" are decompositions.</li>
                        <li>List entries beginning with "(" indicate the syntax (parameter type signatures) for EITE Language routines.</li>
                        <li>List entries beginning with ":" indicate the required syntax for the given Dc, using a form similar to regular expressions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>a bracketed list of Dcs [] indicate a set of possible Dcs</li>
                                <li>a bracketed list of Dcs with a ^ at the beginning indicates an inversion of the set</li>
                                <li>+ indicates 1 or more of the preceding item</li>
                                <li>a Dc ID in brackets with a colon before the closing brackets indicates any syntactically correct sequence of Dcs beginning with the enclosed Dc ID</li>
                                <li>"~" represents the Dc the syntax of which is being defined</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    The remaining list entries are aliases (alternate names for the characters, for ease of look-up).</p>
                <p>The "Description" column contains additional comments regarding the Dc.</p>
                <p>Three columns' contents are directly inherited from the Unicode Standard: Combining class (inherits Unicode's "Canonical_Combining_Class property"), Bidirectional class (inherits Unicode's "Bidi_Class" property), and Type (inherits Unicode's "General_Category" property). The "Simple case mapping" and "Script" columns should also be inherited from Unicode in some manner, but are not at present. For characters not included in Unicode, a reasonable value is chosen in the pattern of the values used by Unicode. If there are discrepancies between this value and Unicode's value for a given character that is in both sets, this should be reported as an error in the EITE Language standard. Unicode's values should take precedence.</p>
                <p>"Type" column values also extend the Unicode Standard's possible values with the "!Cx" category, denoting characters that do not fit neatly into Unicode's existing categories.</p>
            <h5>Notes on specific Dcs</h5>
                <h6>Dcs 241–245: Mode indicators</h6>
                    <p>Inclusion of the mode indicators in documents is <em>optional</em>. The selected mode expresses information about the document's expected execution environment. These modes are shortcuts that set up the environment in advance so that the document does not need to contain specific code to set up these contexts. This lets the resulting documents more concise and readable.</p>
                <h6>Dcs 246–255: Source formatting control</h6>
                    <p>Dcs 246 through 255 control the formatting of the ELS format version of a document.</p>
        <h4>Document formats</h4>
            <p>There are seven file formats defined by this specification. Six of them (dcBasenb, ELS, ELAD, ELQ, DELQ, and SELQ) are general-use formats, while the seventh (ERD, not yet specified) is a special-purpose format with a subset of the other formats' capabilities. DcBasenb and ELS are the primary formats, while ELAD, ELQ, DELQ, and SELQ are intended as an intermediate, more-readable format, and are not intended for information interchange (they are much larger than the other formats for a given document, in general).</p>
            <p><!-- To allow implementations to interpret documents created using newer versions of this format, once a completed version of this specification has been released, the meaning of any given Dc will not change. That will ensure that existing documents retain their meaning when interpreted using a newer version of the specification. While they are semantically stable, they are not necessarily presentation-stable (a Dc representing "A" in one version may look different from one version to the next, but it won't change to represent a "B"). --> Implementations should be able to render a document exactly (bit-for-bit) as determined by earlier versions of the specification. A syntax should be provided to indicate the version of the specification a given Dc, region of Dcs, or document should be displayed using (exactly, not just semantically), although Dcs have not been created for this purpose yet.</p>
            <p>There is a one-to-one correspondence within a given version of the specification and implementation between normalized dcBasenb, ELS, ELAD, ELQ, DELQ, and SELQ files (for any given document in one of those formats, there is only one way to represent it in the other formats), but not for ERD files (because ERD files can only represent a subset of EITE Language documents). That means that documents can be losslessly round-trip-converted between those six formats. <em>However</em>, when converting from an ELS file, if it does not have a version specified, its behavior may change due to changes in the mapping between source code and Dc IDs. Source form should be able to represent syntactically invalid documents unambiguously. Whether structurally invalid source-form documents should be able to be represented as structurally valid Dc sequences is debatable.</p>
            <p>DcBasenb files are a specific interpretation of the private-use-area characters in Unicode text.</p>
            <p>ELAD, ELS, ELQ, DELQ, and SELQ files are subsets of ASCII text files, with lines delimited by 0x0A (line feed). Bytes 0x00 through 0x09, 0x0B through 0x1F, and 0x7F through 0xFF (all ranges inclusive) are disallowed. Files must end with 0x0A. This may later be changed to use UTF-8.</p>
            <p>A less strictly specified formats has an implementation available: "integerList" (.dcil), which is a list of ASCII digits representing Dcs, with each Dc followed by a space (including the last one), and no trailing newline or comments.</p>
            <p>At the end of each format's summary (except for EMR), a simple "Hello, World!" document is given in the format.</p>
            <h5>EITE Language as Unicode Private Use Characters (dcBasenb), .dcbnb.utf8.txt (assuming UTF-8 representation of Unicode)</h5>
                <p>This format uses Unicode characters for Dcs that have losslessly roundtrippable Unicode equivalents, while representing Dcs that are not mappable to Unicode as sequences of Unicode private use area characters. Note that there are multiple possible ways a given Dc or sequence of Dcs can be represented as private use area characters, so only the normalized form (the form output by the implementation) is strictly roundtrippable to Dcs, and only for a given version of the specification and implementation (incidentally, the implementation for importing them does not verify that the normalized form was used and warn otherwise, but it should).</p>
                <pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
            <h5>EITE Language source files (ELS), .els</h5>
                <p>EITE Language source files are a programming language–inspired representation of EITE Language documents. It is the most readable of the formats, but also (along with SELQ, which is defined in terms of it) the most technically complex.</p>
                <pre><code>dc:
    Hello, World!</code></pre>
                <p>or more idiomatically (but not the exact equivalent of the others in terms of the Dcs used),</p>
                <pre><code>say 'Hello, World!'</code></pre>
                <p>which would be</p>

259 # .</code></pre>
                <p>in Dcs, or even more simply the <code>say</code> could be omitted since literals are printed by default: <code>'Hello, World!'</code>.</p>
            <h5>EITE Language in ASCII documents (ELAD), .elad</h5>
                <p>EITE Language in ASCII documents are a list of Dcs. The Dcs mappable to the permitted ASCII characters are represented by those ASCII characters, with the exception of 0x40 "<code>@</code>" (Dc 1). All other Dcs are represented by "<code>@</code>" followed by the integer Dc ID followed by a space, such that, for instance, "<code>@</code>" would be represented as "<code>@1 </code>".</p>
                <pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
            <h5>EITE Language sequence files (ELQ), .elq</h5>
                <p>A list of Dc numbers. Four Dcs are given per line, separated by spaces.</p>
                <pre><code>57 86 93 93

            <h5>Documented EITE Language sequence files (DELQ), .delq</h5>
                <p>A variant of the EMS format for easier reading: after each line, the printable ASCII equivalent of each Dc is given following <code>0x202320</code>, each separated from the next by a space. If there is no printable ASCII equivalent, or the character is a space, "." is used instead.</p>
                <pre><code>57 86 93 93 # H e l l

            <h5>Source-Documented EITE Language sequence files (SELQ), .selq</h5>
                <p>A variant of the ELQ and ELS formats for easier reading: the ELS source version is given in a comment in the style of the DELQ format, but the number of Dcs on each line is determined by the source lines to which they correspond.</p>
                <pre><code># dc:
57 86 93 93 96 96 30 18 72 96 99 93 85 19 #     Hello, World!</code></pre>
            <h5>EITE Record Documents (ERD), .erd</h5>
                <p>This is a special format in the "Structured" mode used for structured record storage in EITE. It is not yet defined, but will most likely be a subset of one of the other formats.</p>
        <h4>Structures in the EITE Language</h4>
            <p>The EITE Language uses the following main types of entity to represent information:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Type</dt><dd>Types are templates describing the structure of objects. They are known as prototypes or classes in most programming languages, depending on whether objects described by them inherit changes to the types made after the object was created. (Objects can be used as types by casting.) Type names begin with a capital letter when in source form.</dd>
                    <dt>Object</dt><dd>An object is an entity that conforms to a given type (an <em>instance</em> of that type). The most general type is <em>object</em>, and there is no need for an object to conform to any other type. Whether the type it inherits from is treated as a class or a prototype should be able to be specified.</dd>
                    <dt>Block</dt><dd>A block is a group of statements.</dd>
                    <dt>Project</dt><dd>A project is a single document, and if relevant, any other documents maintained as part of that document.</dd>
                    <dt>Module</dt><dd>A module is one or more Library-mode documents that have a package name for addressing the things they provide.</dd>
                    <dt>List</dt><dd>A list is an ordered list of objects.<!-- An inline list is begun by <code>[</code> and terminated by <code>]</code>. Example: <code>listName=["a" [5 6] $b]; say $listName[0]</code> stores three Objects in a list named <code>listName</code> and prints <code>a</code>. Objects can be given custom identifiers for addressing them by separating them using <code>: </code>, in which case they should be additionally separated by <code>, </code>. Example: <code>listName=[foo: "a", bar: [5, 6], baz: b]; say $listName[foo]</code>.--></dd>
                    <dt>String</dt><dd>A string is a list of Dcs. Because all Dcs can be used in strings, any data type can be cast to a string, and all data types internally <em>are</em> strings of Dcs.<!-- An inline list is begun by <code>"</code> and terminated by a second <code>"</code>. In source form, <code>"</code> and <code>\</code> must be escaped using <code>\</code>. Example: <code>stringName="Hello, \"World\"!"</code> stores the string <code>Hello, "World"!</code> in a string named <code>stringName</code>. Strings can be concatenated by placing them beside each other: <code>a="foo"; b="baz"; say $a"bar"$b</code> prints <code>foobarbaz</code>. --></dd>
                    <dt>Routine</dt><dd>A routine is a set of instructions for a computer to follow as part of the process of interpreting a document. Similar concepts are known as functions or subroutines in most programming languages, or as methods when used within objects. Routines have an associated structure that indicates what parameters may be passed to it.<!-- >; they will be accessible through a list named <code>!par</code>, and if named, then also through their names. Specifying a return type for a routine is optional. If none is specified, it will be treated as "void", meaning no return type is expected. It is denoted by <code>()</code> followed by a block of statements, with its structure, if desired, within the parentheses. Example: <code>String foo(String, String qux?, *){say $!par[1]$!par[2]$qux}; foo("bar" "baz"); foo("bar" 6 "qux") # qux is 6, param 0 is bar, param 1 is 6, and param 2 is qux; foo(qux=6 "bar") # qux is still 6, but now parameter 0 is 6 and 1 is bar</code> represents an unnamed (positional-only) string parameter, an optional string parameter named "qux", and an unknown number (zero or more) of additional parameters of any type, and prints <pre><code>bazbaz
6qux6
bar6</code></pre>. Because literals are printed by default when at the beginning of a statement, the "invoke" routine must be used to invoke a routine in some cases, such as when referencing a routine by a name stored in a variable or constant: <code>a="I! Am! An! Awkward! Identifier!"; $a(){say "blob"}; invoke $a</code>. An alternative syntax for routine invocation, omitting parentheses, can be used if desired: <code>foo(String, String qux?){}; foo qux=6 bar</code> --></dd>
                    <dt>Operator</dt><dd>An operator is a short notation or syntax pattern for some common routines<!-- (e.g., <code>Number a + Number b</code> in place of <code>add(Number a, Number b)</code>, or <code>if true; then say 'Hello, World!'; else die</code> in place of <code>if(true, (){say 'Hello, World!'}, (){die})</code>) -->.</dd>
                    <dt>Identifier</dt><dd>An identifier is a name for an object.<!-- They are indicated by <code>$</code>, except for identifiers for routines, which do not have the <code>$</code> prefix. Before the <code>$</code> a type signature is often present. Except for routines, <code>!</code> following the <code>$</code> indicates a language-defined identifier, and must be escaped if used as the first character of a custom identifier. For routines, the pattern is inverted: <code>!</code> before an identifier indicates that a custom routine is being referenced (it must be included in calls to <code>invoke</code>, as well). <code>(</code> following the <code>$</code> indicates a special value, not a normal identifier, using Bash's syntax: <code>$(say "foo"; say "bar")</code> represents the output of the code between the <code>(</code> and the <code>)</code>, and <code>$(&lt;foo)</code> represents the contents of the file <code>foo</code>.--></dd>
                    <dt>Structure</dt><dd>A structure is the definition of what the structure is that an entity can have, similar to type definitions or type signatures in some programming languages. A type can contain named Structures without any values for defining an interface.</dd>
                    <dt>Statement</dt><dd>A statement is a logical line of a document. It can be an invocation of a routine, or a declaration of an entity's structure or value.</dd>

                    <p>When a FuzzyList is used in a list, its contents are appended to the list, and it is deconstructed. When a FuzzyList is used in the declaration of the parameters of a Routine, its first elements, starting from 0, are set to the values of the parameters passed to the Routine from its position onwards (so, for example, if the parameters declared are Natural$a,Natural$b,FuzzyList{ lang.set(lang.trait(this.entryLimit),2) }$c,Natural$d,Natural$e and it gets called with 2,3,4,5,6,7,8, then that's an error because there's no place to put 6 (the 5th parameter) (but if the entryLimit weren't set, a=2,b=3,c=(4,5,6),d=7,e=8), and if it gets called with 2,3,4,5,6,7, a=2,b=3,c=(4,5),d=6,e=7).</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>Two interactive mockups are available for this project, to allow you to explore a more completed version of the proposed tools as if you were using them.</p>
    <p>The earlier interactive prototype is available in work-docs/Mockups/12799819e/index.html, while the more recent one is available in work-docs/Mockups/Web-Mockup/index.html.</p>
<h2>User interviews and user testing</h2>

    <p>To learn about how viable and helpful this project would be, I interviewed two people to learn about their use of information technology systems and how they would be affected by the tools proposed here.</p>
    <h3>Interview questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>What tasks do you frequently use information technology (IT) systems to complete? A few examples of information technology systems, for purposes of this question, are computers, telephones, portable music players, and fax machines.</li>
        <li>What aspects of yourself influence your use of, and experience of using, information technology systems? For example, if your job needs you to use IT systems, what is that job and what aspects of it relate to your use of IT systems? Or, if you find IT systems difficult to use because of difficulty processing complex visual stimuli, or because of physical mobility impairments.</li>
        <li>Also, when using information technology systems, are there any other challenges that you face?</li>
        <li>Imagine a computer or smart phone that, when you first start it, presents a list of recent projects you have worked on (such as documents you have had opened), and a list of upcoming projects you have told it about. Would you find a memory aid like that helpful in guiding you to the projects you are there to work on?</li>
        <li>For the next two questions, imagine an IT system that gives you information about current circumstances — your name, where you are, the date and year, and recent news and messages.
        <ol>
            <li>Would that help you feel grounded in the present and more easily able to complete the tasks you are there to work on?</li>
            <li>If you or someone you know has trouble remembering that sort of state information, for instance due to Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, do you think this would be helpful in dealing with that?</li>
        </ol></li>
        <li>Current information technology systems are generally unable to facilitate combining information from various domains of use. For example, if you are writing a textual document, it is not really possible to include a musical composition within that document in such a way that it can still be edited when you send the document to someone else, and that it is a first-class, native feeling part of the document. For the next two questions, consider an IT system that uses a single way of storing and manipulating information for all the types of information it works with. For instance, you could work with a text document and a musical recording within a single document, using a single interface, or you could use a video as the subject of an email.
        <ol>
            <li>Would you find such a system helpful?</li>
            <li>What are some specific situations in your use of IT systems that would benefit from that?</li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thank you for participating in the interview!</p>

    <h3>Responses</h3>
    <p>Note that these responses have been lightly edited to make them clearer. The meaning of the responses is unchanged.</p>
        <h4>Interviewee 1</h4>
            <p>Interviewee 1 works as a church organist and piano teacher.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Computer: Researching music repertoire and performance techniques for my work; learning repertoire; listening to music for work. Telephone: Business and personal contacts.</li>
                <li>No problems except for not always understanding the technology in a complete way and so not always being able to solve problems on my own.</li>
                <li>Financial restrictions in not having all the ideal components for a virtual pipe organ. Also, sometimes information not fitting on a screen correctly, or otherwise not working as it should.</li>
                <li>I don’t have so many projects going at once that I cant keep track of them.</li>
                <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Perhaps if I had a condition like Alzheimer's disease, but otherwise, no. Recent news would be a distraction unless that was my field of work.</li>
                    <li>Yes, it could be helpful. I believe.</li>
                </ol></li>
                <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Yes, that could be helpful. It would prevent the need to make two (or possibly more) separate communications, in some cases.</li>
                    <li>Trying to share a photo with commentary attached or a musical composition with my questions attached and also to get a critique.</li>

                        <li>Finding information about people and businesses</li>
                        <li>To guide my travels via GPS</li>
                        <li>Emailing</li>
                        <li>Research of products and subjects of interest</li>
                        <li>Backing up information</li>

                        <li>Finding, creating, and sharing recipes</li>
                        <li>Journaling</li>
                        <li>Making and publishing videos</li>
                        <li>Publishing digital music</li>
                        <li>Taking photos</li>
                        <li>Opening the garage door</li>
                        <li>Making shopping lists</li>
                        <li>As a metronome</li>
                        <li>To create editable documents using OCR</li>
                        <li>To measure the level of sound</li>
                        <li>To create animation</li>
                        <li>To practice piano</li>
                        <li>To recreate orchestras</li>
                        <li>To alter photos</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>My work is in music, and I use a computer and an iPhone extensively to support that work, as can be gleaned from the list above.<br />
                As long as images are relatively static, I can manage OK visually, although my eyes will get tired. When things are moving quickly, it is a challenge even when my eyes are fresh. Watching a movie with subtitles can be a challenge, for instance.</li>
                <li>Because I often interact with others via video chat, internet connection issues can often present challenges.<br />
                Because I use IT systems so extensively in my work, I am often challenged by the fact that my formative years did not include "thinking like a computer." In other words, using IT systems is not second nature to me.</li>
                <li>I think I would have to be shown how it would intersect with my workflow. I am used to using Calendar to keep my appointments straight, and I use Notes to make lists of projects when they become too numerous to hold in my "internal memory," so to speak. I am generally reluctant to learn new applications when what I am using is basically working for me, but when I am shown that it is in my best interest to do so, I overcome the reluctance.</li>
                <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>I have such an IT system. I can ask Siri for any of that information.</li>
                    <li>I think it could be helpful, especially if someone was still in the work force, or if they still were striving to meet the challenges of living alone, or of helping to care for others.</li>
                </ol></li>
                <li>
                <ol>
                    <li>I think it would be brilliant. Helpful? Absolutely.</li>
                    <li>Oh, goodness. I might send a recording to a client, and in the email mention specific passages about which I wanted them to comment; with such a holistic system, focusing their attention would be easy. Again, I sometimes send links to YouTube videos I have posted, and it would be great if it weren't necessary for the recipient to leave the email client in order to view and comment.<br />
                    When creating text documents, I often want to incorporate photos or other materials; it is always a struggle because the applications that are best for the text aren't as nimble when managing other materials. I can absolutely see the value in being able to incorporate both video and sound files, for instance, in such documents.<br />
                    Also, it would be wonderful to be able to add recorded verbal content (or even video) as a response to emails or other documents received from others. It is often easier and faster to speak impressions and complex responses to things than to write them.</li>
                </ol></li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Summary of findings</h4>
            <p>These interview responses show that various aspects of the proposed information technology system would be helpful. The interviews find some parts of the project helpful and others not necessarily so for their specific goals. Consequently, to make the proposed system ideal for all users, a method should be provided to allow users to choose which of its capabilities they would like to use. That way, the interface they have is the most relevant to them personally, and thus the most helpful in solving the particular problems they face.</p>
    <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>While these personas are based on the interview respondents, they are somewhat fictionalized.</p>
        <h4>Persona 1</h4>
            <p>Lara is a 37-year-old professional church organist. They make extensive use of computers to manage business communications, and to simulate an organ for practice at home. Their work often requires communicating with their employer regarding music and business. To discuss music with their employer, it is often not practical to use a computer, and it is necessary to meet in person, due to the limitation of current information technology systems. If computers could provide tools for easily sharing and collaborating on scores and recorded performances of those scores, Lara’s job would be made easier by reducing travel time and the requirement of meeting in person to work on things that do not actually need an in-person meeting.</p>
        <h4>Persona 2</h4>
            <p>Joseph is a 40-year-old film teacher at a large public university. They use non-linear editing software in computers to edit films, and to demonstrate film editing in class to their students, as well as to work on separate projects for independent clients. Because the people they work for often have a hard time communicating what they want in a project, several iterations of work and feedback are needed before a finished product is delivered. Consequently, Joseph would be better able to communicate with students and clients if they could work with film in the way their non-linear editing software allows, but collaboratively online with the clients and students, like cloud-based collaborative word processors allow. If there were a single editing tool for text and films, the same collaboration abilities from one medium would be available in others, making Joseph’s job a lot easier and allowing more efficient communication between Joseph and their clients.</p>
    <h3>Proposed user acceptance testing strategy</h3>
        <p>To test the viability of this project, I would suggest developing a functional instance of it, and presenting it to a range of users who work with various challenges to using information technology systems. For testing the general viability of the project, it would not be necessary to fully implement all the features that would be needed to make it competitive with other information technology systems; rather, it would only be needed to implement a representative subset of capabilities that would allow the users to explore the general interface and the system’s basic interaction structure. To gather data on challenges that users might encounter in using the system, the testers should be presented with a task to complete using the system, and asked to give commentary on their experience of the tool, and any frustration they encounter during the process, while they work on completing the assigned task. An article from the Nielsen Norman Group states that “A scripted study of product usage is done in order to focus the insights on specific usage aspects, such as on a newly redesigned flow.” [Rohrer, 2014] Consequently, that seems like the correct user testing strategy for determining the viability of this proposal, and finding roadblocks in its usability.</p>
    <h3>User Feedback on Edit Tool Web extension (March 4, 2019)</h3>
        <p>I have seen and attempted to use two versions of this tool. The earlier version worked more completely for testing purposes, and from that I got a clear idea of how the tool might be useful, both in general, and for me personally.</p>
        <p>It would be helpful to have a succinct description of the various elements and their relationships, as the layout does not make that immediately clear. For instance, the left-to-right orientation of the tabs at the bottom of the page at first suggested to me that perhaps each of the three would be used in any one application, whereas their use is not sequential.</p>
        <p>It seems as though an unnecessary amount of space is allowed for the “Click to Insert” list, both vertically and horizontally. The list itself is not in an obvious order, and so locating a desired value takes more time than seems ideal. A search feature of this list might make it more navigable.</p>
        <p>Having the dropdown menus perhaps within the main buttons that they modify would help me visually.</p>
        <p>When this tool is ready for use, I would find it useful on my website for displaying musical excerpts within the context of textual analysis of musical compositions. Likewise, on my YouTube channel, it will be useful for displaying the opening measures of music for multi-movement works, as an aid to navigation within a video.</p>
        <p>I would also find it useful to create custom buttons for my online store.</p>
        <p>I might also use this tool when collaborating with other musicians and writers for instant messaging musical ideas, especially when editing or suggesting changes for performance.</p>

    <tbody>
    <tr><td>Web (JavaScript for current Firefox)</td><td>web</td><td>This is the main implementation available so far. It is incomplete, but more complete than any other. It is quite slow because most StageL routine calls currently are treated as JavaScript functions declared with async and called with await, which requires creating a new Promise object for every call.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Firefox extension</td><td>edit-webextension</td><td>A Firefox extension is available that wraps the Web implementation's edit tool and allows loading text from Web pages into the edit tool, and editing the contents of text pages using the edit tool. As only the edit tool is available, this is not a full EITE implementation for this platform; access to the other elements needs to be provided as well. To install the Firefox extension, add it to Firefox using about:debugging (it will only stay installed while Firefox stays open). To use it, select some text to view (or place the cursor in a text-field to edit), then click the toolbar button. The text will be made available in the pop-up edit tool. To put the edited text back into a text-field, click the Done button in the lower right corner.</td></tr>

<h5>EITE Specification</h5>


<h6>Purpose of this document</h6>
    <p>The EITE specification indicates the various interfaces that an EITE implementation provides: APIs and tools for humans. The specific manner of implementation of these is not described here. (Partial implementations could be possible that, for instance, only provide importing and exporting (without running) documents, or that omit some supported formats, or that do not provide the tools.) The main EITE implementation software attempts to be a full implementation of this specification.</p>
    <p>This is a work in progress and will likely change as it is developed.</p>

<h6>Platforms</h6>
    <p>For specific platforms' implementations of EITE, see <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/platforms">[http://futuramerlin.com/platforms]: the dedicated subpage</a>.</p>

<h6>EITE tools</h6>
    <p>The following natively implemented tools should be available in a full implementation: <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/tool-testrunner.htm">[http://futuramerlin.com/tool-testrunner.htm]: test runner</a>, <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/tool-docrunner.htm">[http://futuramerlin.com/tool-docrunner.htm]: document runner</a>, <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/tool-implrunner.htm">[http://futuramerlin.com/tool-implrunner.htm]: main EITE implementation runner</a>, and <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/tool-edit.htm">[http://futuramerlin.com/tool-edit.htm]: simple document edit tool</a>. They are not EITE documents; rather they are implemented for each platform, so they can be used in the course of developing and testing the EITE implementation. The also serve to some extent as sanity checks for the API functionality for a new implementation, as they would not work without the APIs available.</p>

<h6>EITE implementation public APIs</h6>
    <p>These APIs are implemented in public-interface.stagel.</p>

<h6>EITE Tool Documentation: Document Runner</h6>


<h7>Document runner operation</h7>
    <p>The document runner is one of the native tools included in a full EITE implementation. It has not yet been implemented. It should prompt for the path to a document to run, and load and run that document.</p>
<h6>EITE Tool Documentation: Edit Tool</h6>


<h7>Edit tool introduction</h7>
    <p>The edit tool is one of the native tools included in a full EITE implementation. It allows importing and exporting documents using the EITE library, running documents, and editing documents as dcBasenb (extended Unicode), ELS (not yet implemented), or a whitespace-separated series of integers.</p>
    <p>Here is a screenshot of the edit tool for the Web implementation (found in web/edit.htm in the EITE installation root):
        <img src="assets/06db233abee56203cbae30385e217fc3ef47829aa00a75ea4ebd989e0f7eff228472a2924079dc5b0d4f4ca442d99d308c45b32bc4765d5d0d70b554af5004b4.png" alt="Screenshot of edit tool" />
    </p>

<h7>Edit tool interface</h7>
    <p>The edit tool interface for the Web implementation consists of three vertical panels, and a horizontal row of buttons below the three panels. The center panel is where the editable contents of a document are shown. At the top is a dropdown menu for choosing what format to edit the document in. Below this dropdown is a label showing what Dc is currently at the cursor position. The right panel is where the document's output will be shown when it is run. The left panel is for locating and inserting Dcs into the document; clicking one will insert it into the document at the current cursor position. The three buttons in the bottom row allow importing, exporting, or running the document. The import and export buttons have dropdown menus to choose what format to import or export documents as.</p>
    <p>Other implementations may have different user interfaces, but should offer equivalent functionality.</p>
<h6>EITE Tool Documentation: EITE Implementation Runner</h6>


<h7>EITE implementation runner operation</h7>
    <p>The EITE implementation runner is one of the native tools included in a full EITE implementation. Its purpose is to host and run an instance of the EITE implementation document (eite.sems), by providing the necessary execution environment and running the startEite routine. It does not need to provide any user interface beyond that provided by the eite.sems document.</p>
    <p>Here is a screenshot of a very rough mockup of what this might look like:
        <img src="assets/deb67cb83c870d81ca12018a72d7cafe5ff5721be96343bf127c597e2c37734018282aaf5b16234bc5e112682f6f2e6337a6aaeb73c61aaed3cf5bfbded80be8.png" alt="Screenshot of EITE implementation runner mockup" />
    </p>
<h6>EITE Tool Documentation: Test Runner</h6>


<h7>Test runner operation</h7>
    <p>The test runner is one of the native tools included in a full EITE implementation. Its purpose is to load an instance of the EITE library, and run the unit tests included in the StageL build for the platform by running the "runTests" routine, displaying the outputs. It runs automatically, without the need for human intervention once it has been started. To do this, it needs to provide an output context that the runTests routine can use for displaying the test results.</p>
    <p>Here is a screenshot of the test runner for the Web implementation (found in web/tests.htm in the EITE installation root) while running the test suite:
        <img src="assets/f1b5250f4bf628c3fc697e7723a1c4c1385f43691745f3f0e59b038ef9c3f52e3a92583674ff526cf5dd0dff05ac5499435dce04e4e910f41990dadc3d2f7cba.png" alt="Screenshot of test runner" />

<h5>StageL: Simple staging language</h5>


<h6>Overview</h6>
    <p>A simple programming language is provided for easily writing portable algorithms to be transpiled to and used by programs in other languages. The name "StageL" comes from calling it a "staging language" (which refers to its being a tool for developing the main EITE software, which should provide a more complete language).<!-- Also, "StageL" sounds catchy, and should be relatively easy to search for. It does seem reminiscent of "stage left" in theater, but that doesn't really have anything to do with it. --> This project was inspired by the ugly code that resulted when I tried to write using these principles directly in JavaScript, needing a lot of easy-to-mess-up boilerplate code and awkward notation (largely because it is not strongly typed).</p>
<h6>Design goals</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Imperative language. Trivial to implement, learn, and read; extremely portable.</li>
        <li>Provide function calls, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and operators for these types with strict typing. Objects and first-class functions are out of scope for this language. (It's closer to duck-typed in practice, as e.g. in Bash there would be no distinction between string 0 and number 0.)</li>
        <li>Implemented as a transpiler that accepts a file as input and produces a file in the target language as output.</li>
        <li>Have an implementation of itself using itself, to provide testing and portability of the language.</li>
        <li>Have an implementation in Bash.</li>
        <li>Should transpile to (eventually) JavaScript, C, Java, Bash, PHP, Microsoft CIL, Lisp, x86 assembly, and Python, at least, in roughly that order of priority. (JavaScript has been completed for work on the main EITE software; C and Java should follow soon thereafter for their portability; the other languages are nice to have to cover a diverse range of development environments, and additionally, in the case of CIL/x86 assembly/Lisp, of providing interesting challenges in ensuring that the language really is easily portable due to their difference from the others.)</li>
        <li>Focus on simplicity and portability: it should purely be an algorithm representation format, without input/output capabilities. It is for implementing the algorithms of a program once, and having it be available in various languages. Things such as input/output and native calls should be provided as an API specification for the StageL source file: at the top of the file, it should declare all the implementation-dependent functions that it requires; these would then be provided separately by the programmer and/or by a set of functions provided with StageL for each target language. (This was loosened in practice and a standard library with some basic I/O is required.)</li>
        <li>All input/output to/from the language is as functions. All code must be in a function, with declared parameters, parameter types, variables needed, and return type. (The expense of the simple type system is that changing return values would break functions' API, since "out" parameters and/or pointers would not be available, but this should allow the code to be simple and readable, which is a priority for this language.)</li>
        <li>Output files should retain the structure and comments of the input files, thereby retaining readability as far as the target language permits.</li>
        <li>All behavior should be specified. Ambiguous programs should be impossible to write knowing the specification, and (as far as possible) the meaning of a program should be obvious and unambiguous <em>without</em> the language specification. Programs that do not match the specification exactly should be entirely rejected, rather than produce warnings or having a best guess of its meaning made.</li>
    </ul>
<h6>Actual results of the design goals</h6>
    <p>It works satisfactorily. It's pretty portable, I think. Things aren't fully specified because it transpiles to native constructs that behave differently between target languages. This could be resolved by implementing a virtual machine or similar in each target language, but that's a pain, so this is good enough for what this is for. Low-level facilities aren't really available yet. I guess they can be added as additional builtin routines. One option might be implementing a WebAssembly VM or something that is available implemented purely in StageL, but can be accessed natively if available to be faster.</p>
<h6>Syntax</h6>
    <p>Lines are separated by 0x0A. Each line consists of printable ASCII text: a–z, 0–9, apostrophe, slash, spaces, &lt;, &gt;, [, ], (, ), {, and }, and any other printable ASCII characters in string literals or comments (apostrophe is not yet available in string literals). Within a line is a sequence of space-delimited words. Semantic levels are denoted by four spaces' indentation. The first word in a line is a command. Comments (started with #) and string literals can contain any printable ASCII (although string literals can't contain ' because it's used to indicate them; this could probably be fixed easily enough at some point (TODO)). Identifiers can contain ASCII text a-z A-Z and 0-9 (but 0-9 may not be the first character, and code that relies on case sensitivity or insensitivity by having ident references differ only in case or having two idents that differ only in case is a (possibly un-notified-about) error (these are not technical restrictions; they're just required in the interest of portability)).</p>
    <p>There are a number of built-in commands in the core language, which is in core.js or whatever your output language is. There are also commands from the standard library, which is in portable.js.</p>
    <h7>Gotchas</h7>
    <ul>
        <li>Whitespace is (usually) significant. There isn't a 1:1 correspondence between valid source files and the parsed code, though, I don't think. Indentation must be with 4 spaces.</li>
        <li>Unexpected byte values in code files aren't allowed and should cause the parser to die; strings or comments containing byte values other than printable ASCII are an error.</li>
        <li>The value of a variable before it has been set in a given block is undefined; don't access it until it has been set (and don't rely on variable hoisting). That's an error, but there isn't anything in place to detect it.</li>
        <li>Argument lists can contain references to any type.</li>
        <li>Strings are not intended to be used for data interchange; rather they're for process-internal use for making semantically clear array mappings and such — they don't have any Unicode or binary-safe support, or even full printable ASCII support (' isn't supported in strings) for that matter. An integer array representing bytes is preferred for when you need to actually keep more careful track of data.</li>
        <li>Routine parameter types can be generic, string, number, bool, or array. Void is not an allowed parameter type (although I'm not sure what that would actually mean).</li>
        <li>Routine return types can be string, number, bool, array, or void. Generic return type is not allowed, separate routines for each return type desired must be used instead.</li>
        <li>Routines can be composed in argument lists, but unless you close the parameter lists explicitly using <code>}</code>, only one inner routine can be used per argument list; the inner routine must be the last argument. Using <code>}</code> or temporary variables is needed in other cases. For example: <code>set n/foo add 2 mod 7 5</code> sets n/foo to 4, but you can't do <code>set n/foo add mod 7 5 2</code> or <code>set n/foo add mod 7 5 mod 7 5</code> are errors, although they won't necessarily give an error (they will be interpreted as add(mod(7,5,2)) and add(mod(7,5,mod(7,5))) respectively, with the third argument to mod probably being discarded by the implementation). Instead, you can write these as <code>set n/foo add mod 7 5 } 2</code> or <code>set n/foo add mod 7 5 } mod 7 5</code>, respectively.</li>
        <li>Some commands (e.g. new, return) can't handle routines in argument lists; this <strong>should</strong> die with an error, but no promises.</li>
        <li>Referencing or assigning to a variable that has not been assigned is an error, but there isn't anything in place to detect it.</li>
        <li>Code like:<pre><code>r/s/fbSwitcher n/num
    if eq 0 mod n/num 15
        return 'Buzz'</code></pre> is an error, because if the if statement is not true, the function will exit without returning (basically being a void). There's nothing in place to detect this, though. This example is from <code>cli/tests/stagel/js/routine-fbSwitcher-return-type/in/in.stagel</code>, which should perhaps be rewritten to not have this fault (ideally, a check for this problem would be added to the transpiler or generated code, but I can't be bothered right now). Likewise, routines with a return type but no return statement are an error without any detection.</li>
        <li>In assignments, calls, etc. where routines can be composed, they usually have to be evaluated strictly left to right. Thus, <code>set n/a sub len s/b 1</code> is an error (I don't think there is any detection for this): it will be interpreted as <code>set(n/a, sub(len(s/b, 1)))</code> when what is desired is <code>set(n/a, sub(len(s/b), 1))</code>. It should instead either use the inline-arglist-end marker <code>}</code> and be written as <code>set n/a sub len s/b } 1</code>, or be written as two statements: first <code>set n/a len s/b</code>, then <code>set n/a sub n/a 1</code>.</li>
        <li>Type constraints are generally only enforced when values are returned or given as parameters (in which case they are checked by code automatically inserted into the routine called during transpilation). Thus, for instance, you can assign the wrong datatype to a variable without it showing an error, and it will only die when it gets returned or passed to another routine.</li>
        <li>Array literals can (probably) only be used with the <code>set</code> command. For other things, make a temp value, assign the array literal to it, and then use the temp value in its place.</li>
        <li>Whitespace requirements apply to lines where the entire line is a comment, too.</li>
        <li>Comments have to be on their own lines.</li>
	<li>What's wrong with this code? <pre><code>    while lt 8 len an/res
                set an/res push [ 0 ] an/res
	</code></pre> The array bracket type doesn't match the content type: [ is for strings, while ( is for numbers.</li>
	<li><code><pre>set an/remainderArr anSubset an/in -5 -1 # last 4 characters</pre></code> breaks; the comment needs to be on a separate line.</li>
	<li>Code like <code><pre>set as/data append as/data [ s/key s/val ]</pre></code> is an error: array literals can't contain variables in their definitions.</li>
    <li>Perhaps test conditions should have to be on the same line as the test keyword. For example, <pre><code>if
    lt n/a 0</code></pre> would be an error; it should be written as <code>if lt n/a 0</code> instead. Previously it was intended to support splitting them onto separate lines, but it is tedious to implement, and somewhat makes the StageL code harder to read anyway. As a result, this perhaps should be an error.</li>
    <li><code>until</code> statements don't work (search for "This doesn't work. I guess it'll just be necessary to forgo split-line untils for now, although I'm not sure split-line commands are really desirable regardless. FIXME" in the code).</li>
    </ul>
    <h7>Example</h7>
    <pre><code>
r/s/fbSwitcher n/num
    if eq 0 mod n/num 15
        return 'FizzBuzz' # just a literal sequence of ASCII printable characters.
    # Comment
    if eq 0 mod n/num 5
        return 'Buzz' # Comment 2
        # Comment 3
    if # Could also write it like this, with the condition on another line
        eq 0 mod n/num 3
        return 'Fizz' # Comment 4

r/s/fizzBuzz # A string is an array of ASCII printable characters.
    # return-assert -n # the output should be non-empty.
    new n/counter 1

<h6>Scope</h6>
    <p>Values are available until the end of the block they are in. Whether they propagate outside of the block is undefined. Accessing them outside the block, or before the line they are defined, is an error, but there isn't anything in place to detect it. Use routine return values to move things around.</p>

<h6>Errors</h6>
    <p>When an error is encountered, it will produce a message somehow. Execution of the program may stop. Otherwise, behavior is undefined. For instance, in JavaScript in browser it will send a console log message. In bash, it will call "die" from ember-shared.</p>

<h6>Types and basic commands for them</h6>
    <p>Routines that have type "v" are void. These are all the primitive commands that are implemented natively for each language. Other commands are included in StageR library of useful commands. Type "g" is generic, can only be used as a parameter for a routine. It indicates it can be either string, int, or bool. Type "ga", can also only be used as a parameter, is a generic array, which is either an array of ints, an array of strings, or an array of bools (an array can't contain a mixture), and all arrays passed to a routine that accepts generic-array parameters must be the same type (e.g. all int arrays). Type "gi" (generic item(s)) is like "ga" but can also be a single bool, int, or string.</p>
    <h7>b: Booleans</h7>
        <p>Can be True or false. Can not be undefined (initialized to false).</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>r/b/and n/a n/b</dt><dd>Returns bool a and b</dd>
            <dt>r/b/or n/a n/b</dt><dd>Returns bool a or b</dd>
            <dt>r/b/not n/a n/b</dt><dd>Returns bool a not b</dd>
        </dl>
    <h7>n: Numbers (integer only)</h7>
        <p>Can be 0, or positive integer. Can not be undefined (initialized to 0). Currently is restricted to 32-bit signed (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647), but may be increased if more are needed.</p>

        </dl>
    <h7>s: Strings</h7>
        <p>A sequence of characters: can be ASCII printable characters or space. No newlines or control characters, I guess. The string support isn't supposed to be very capable, just easy to implement lowest-common-denominator between target languages for making labels for stuff and whatever. For actual data, use arrays of integers.</p>

        <p>These operate on str/int/bool.</p>
        <dt>r/s/strFrom g/input</dt><dd>Give string with contents.</dd>
    <h7>Array utility routines</h7>
        <p>A set of routines for managing arrays apply to any of the three array types (except the typed subset ones). Note that the push/append/prepend functions may not check that the type of the item being added to the array matches the array type; calling it with mismatched parameters is an error but may not be reported.

<h2>Ember Library</h2>


<h3>Library Section 1: Basic knowledge, to be included in the text of this specification</h3>
    <p>This section of the library will require research and writing. It should consist of many short sections, each covering a topic. Each of these sections should list all other sections that must be understood as prerequisites for understanding it; the dependency tree of every section should culminate in a single section that gives a basic understanding of the dominant language of the reference (probably English, for the forseeable future), so that by translating that one section into another language, every other concept in the reference can be understood by reading its section and its section's prerequisites.</p>
    <!-- <h4>Library Section 1 Contents</h4>
    <p>See <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/section-1/">[http://futuramerlin.com/section-1/]: the dedicated sub-page</a>.</p> -->

<h3>Library Section 2: Great cultural works, to be included as digital data as part of this specification</h3>
    <!--
    <h4>Library Section 2 Contents</h4>
    <p>See <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/section-2/">[http://futuramerlin.com/section-2/]: the dedicated sub-page</a>.</p> -->
    <h4>Using the Web environment</h4>
        <p>This section of the library includes a Web environment as a Vagrant appliance. (For more information on installing and using Vagrant, visit <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/">[https://docs.vagrantup.com/]: the Vagrant Documentation Web site</a> or reference the book <i>Vagrant: Up and Running</i> (Mitchell Hashimoto, 2013). When using the Vagrant appliance, it may be advisable to disconnect the media library’s storage medium before running vagrant destroy, because if you are running Vagrant as a user with write permission to the folder, it may follow the symlink and erase it. This seems to possibly be a bug in Vagrant; this may be related to <a href="https://github.com/MSOpenTech/vagrant-azure/issues/30">[https://github.com/MSOpenTech/vagrant-azure/issues/30]: this issue</a>.</p>
        <p>To start using the Web environment, cd to the “Meta/Web environment” folder. If there is not a Vagrantfile in the folder (there should be), run:</p>
        <pre><code>vagrant init <a href="https://archive.org/download/virtualbox_201501/virtualbox.box">https://archive.org/download/virtualbox_201501/virtualbox.box</a></code></pre>
        <p>and update the Vagrantfile as desired. If there is already a Vagrantfile, continue to the next step: run <code>vagrant up</code>.</p>

<h3>Library Section 3: The data held by the Ember cloud infrastructure</h3>
    <p>This section of the library will presumably be too much information to be included in the Ember specification, although future information storage technology advances may render that less of an issue.</p>
<h3>Ember Library: Contents of section 1</h3>


<h4>Base section</h4>
    <p>This section should have no prerequisites. It should contain a summary of the basics of English in many languages to allow the other sections to be understood.</p>

<h4>Studying</h4>
    <p>It is important to study. To study effectively is challenging.</p>
    <h5>How to Study</h5>

<h4>Mathematics</h4>
<h4>Physical sciences</h4>
<h4>Chemistry</h4>
<h4>History</h4>
    <h5>1900s</h5>
        <p>In 1969, the Apollo 11 carried astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin into space, who then landed on the moon.</p>

At a minimum, lossless information exporting should be available, with documentation of the format in which it is exported. Google Drive, for instance, does not provide any lossless, documented, supported export format. They offer some supported and documented formats, but they are not lossless (particularly significant is the absence of export of document revision history, despite that history being stored and exposed via the user interface). Some success has been reported with retrieving their native format, but it is not documented, supported, or easily accessible (<a href="https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/45562">https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/45562</a>; <a href="http://features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs/">http://features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs/</a>).</li>

The popular Slack messaging app is designed to capture its users' data, without allowing it to be easily exported: a Slack user cannot export (or even view) all the data they have access to. This prevents people from practically preserving their data stored using Slack. Their business model relies on capturing users' data, and holding it hostage until organizations need it enough to pay them for it.</li>
        <li>Snapchat (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat</a>), like Slack, is a company that predicates its entire business model on the wanton destruction of history: it provides a communications tool that is marketed upon the premise that messages sent with it are forgotten.

        <li>The Adobe Illustrator vector drawing program doesn't have a smudge brush, although Adobe Photoshop does. There isn't a technical barrier to this (a smudge brush could be implemented by having a final pass over the rasterized artwork applying the equivalent Photoshop transformation), but because a smudge brush is a raster-centric concept, it is not provided even though it would be useful.</li>

Eventually, this data could maybe be stored in and generated from that, or something, although more structured data would be needed to do that and it might be more trouble than it is worth. -->
    <p>Note (2019 Jan. 26a27): The ember-web-site, wreathe-conf, and ember-web-site-snapshots repositories have not been publicly available for a while (leaked some possibly sensitive information in them). I've finally gotten around to doing something about it, though, by cleaning and then dropping the history from the repositories, and force pushing over the current ones. I'll set them back to public once the Git hosts do garbage collection. The versions of the repositories from before the force pushes are included in ember-library-2 to preserve the history. (I was too lazy to be selective in cleaning them up such that a sanitized copy of the repos' old commit history could stay public; this was much easier, sorry.) Anyway, that's why they've disappeared — sorry for the silence, procrastination strikes again... :P Update 2019 Apr. 9: It's necessary to re-do this, since it turns out GitHub at least doesn't do GC, or at least it hasn't yet (procedure: back up current repo, rename current remote repo, create new blank remote repo, remove old history from local copy (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41953300/how-to-delete-the-old-git-history), push to remote, unbreak GitLab mirror by moving and then creating a new blank project and setting up mirroring for it). This is done for ember-web-site, which is now public again, yay! The other two still need it.</p>

    <h4>Miscellaneous repositories</h4>
        <p>These two repositories hold a record of the status of copies of the Ember project data. As of this writing, neither copy is complete ("elegiac" is a small test copy of a subset of the data used for testing the software during development, and "remote" has not finished the initial process of getting a copy). (The git repositories are held separately with a copy in the computer used for development and a copy at GitHub, and the other data are held at the Internet Archive. Eventually, there should be various mirrors with the entirety of the Ember project data.)</p>

<h3>Getting the data</h3>
    <p>This section discusses how to download the data of, and the projects maintained by, Ember. These instructions will result in the creation of a development environment for the repositories similar to the one used by Ember. If you want to use the Ember tools for working with this environment, and are not using Wreathe 7.3, then additional configuration steps should be taken after getting the data (see "Configuring the environment"). If you just want to examine the contents, or use standard Git tools with it, those steps are not necessary. If you are using Wreathe 7.3, these commands for getting the development data should either be run in the root directory, or else the existing <code>/Ember Library</code> folder should be moved to the desired loctaion, and the value of the <code>EmberLibrary</code> configuration field for Crystallize set to that new location as described in the "Configuring the environment" section below.</p>

    <p>It is important to check the information in the "Working with Stream Registry repositories, and crystal backups" if you are concerned that you may not be getting all the data you want.</p>

    <h4>Getting only the basic repositories</h4>
        <p>Unless you are working on Wreathe or investigating the history of Ember, you probably don't need the Wreathe repositories or Ember history repositories, which are pretty big. This section does not discuss getting them. If you do want them, see the next section. To get these basic repositories, run the following command in the directory where you want the Ember development data to be stored.</p>

        <pre><code>declare -a emberProjects=("ember" "ember-information-technology-environment" "ember-library" "ember-web-site"); declare -a emberSatelliteProjects=("crystallize" "ember-shared" "futuramerlin-web-toolkit" "warcdealer"); set -e; mkdir -p Ember\ Library; cd Ember\ Library || exit 1; git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethus3h/ember.git Ember; cd Ember || exit 1; for i in "${emberProjects[@]}"; do git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethus3h/"$i".git; done; cd ..; mkdir Ember\ satellite\ projects; cd Ember\ satellite\ projects || exit 1; for i in "${emberSatelliteProjects[@]}"; do git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethus3h/"$i".git; done; cd ../.. || exit 1; echo "Finished downloading Ember."</code></pre><br />

    <h4>Getting all public repositories</h4>
        <p>This section discusses getting all publicly available Ember data, which is quite large. Unless you are working on Wreathe or investigating the history of Ember, you probably don't need this, and can use the previous section to get a more limited subset of data.</p>
        <p>These main instructions do not currently get the ember-library-2, personal, or personal-private repositories, the first and third because they are not currently publicly available, and the second (and third) because they are probably of limited interest. To get this more complete set of repositories, run the following command in the directory where you want the Ember development data to be stored.</p>
        <pre><code>git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-meta.git Ember\ Library</code></pre><br />

        <h5>About the "ember-library-2" repository</h5>
            <p>The "ember-library-2" repository is not currently publicly available, and is weird and complicated. It is an overlay on top of the ember-meta repository. To use it, clone it and then move its .git directory to <code>Ember/ember-library/ember-library-2/.egup.git</code> (within the main <code>EmberLibrary</code> folder — see the section "Configuring the environment" below). From a semantic perspective, the ember-meta repository should be considered part of the ember-library-2 repository, but having a submodule with the same working directory as the current git repository is kinda weird and confusing and I'm not really sure how to do it, so I haven't done that yet.</p>

        <h5>Getting the "personal" repository (and about the "personal-private" repository)</h5>
            <p>If you really do want this, go to the folder where you ran the above command, and run: <code>cd Ember\ Library/Ember\ satellite\ projects; git clone https://github.com/ethus3h/personal.git</code>. (The "personal-private" repository works in the same manner as this, but is not currently publicly available.)</p>

    <h4>Configuring and using the environment</h4>
        <p>This step is only needed if you want to use the Ember tools to work with the development environment, and are not using Wreathe 7.3 (which has this already taken care of). If you just want to examine its contents or develop it using standard Git tools, this is not necessary.</p>
        <p>To use these tools (egup/eogup), a copy of Crystallize must be installed and configured with the <code>EmberLibrary</code> configuration field set to the location of the folder (called "Ember Library") containing the development environment. For example, if as in the Ember setup the folder is in the root directory, the Crystallize configuration file (crystallize.conf) would contain a line reading '<code>EmberLibrary,/Ember Library</code>'. Also, the scripts with names beginning with "egup" and "eogup" that are in the <code>usr/bin</code> folder of the wreathe-base repository must be executable and available in the <code>PATH</code> for your user and the root user on your system.</p>
        <p>To synchronise your changes to the development environment, run <code>egup</code>, or <code>eogup</code> if there isn't a Web connection available or GitHub is unavailable, if you have remote commit privileges. (If you do not have remote commit privileges, use a fork of the repository you want to work on, in the traditional Git manner.) To build the Ember Web site, run <code>egup-web</code>.</p>

    <h4>Working with Stream Registry repositories, and crystal backups</h4>
        <p>Five of the repositories (ember-library-2, ember-history, personal, personal-private, and wreathe-packages) contain contents stored using the stream registry feature of Crystallize. This method of storing data keeps pointers to the files in the Git repositories, and stores the actual file contents elsewhere (currently only the Internet Archive; additional mirrors should be added for redundancy). A copy of those file contents is necessary to be able to access the data referenced by those pointers. This means that to obtain a complete copy of these repositories, a list of the addresses of the data (the crystal addresses) that the pointers depend on must be generated from the pointers, and then those crystals must be copied locally. In addition, there are two other sources of data stored at the Internet Archive that may be desired. First, the ember-library-2 repository contains a folder <code>.rubberfs/history</code> that contains a set of files that reference incremental snapshots of the filesystem used for Ember development. These incremental snapshots are ZFS replication streams that can be used by sending them back into an empty ZFS filesystem. They are stored as crystals, and can be added to the set of crystal addresses to be backed up locally if desired. Second, the ember-web-site repostiory contains a folder <code>people/elliot/music</code> that contains files with names ending in <code>.conf</code> describing various musical works released by Elliot (only tangentially related to Ember, but described here for completeness). Some of those files contain lines beginning with "<code>ia,</code>". The part of those lines after that prefix is an Internet Archive identifier for an item containing the files of the item described in that <code>.conf</code> file. Because crystal addresses are a subset of Internet Archive identifiers, and the tools for managing Crystallize backups should work with all Internet Archive items as a general rule, these identifiers can be added to the list of crystal addresses to be backed up as well, if desired.<!-- FIXME: Getting a list of all these remaining crystal identifiers/IA addresses and backing them up should be an automatable/automated process. --></p>

<h2>Crystallize</h2>


<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>A collection of tools for working with files and filesystems.</p>
    <p class="hatnote">Note: There is an oddity in the version numbering: version 2.15.5.9.1 was followed immediately by version 2.15.5.9.3 (skipping 2.15.5.9.2); version 2.15.5.9.2 was then released following version 2.15.5.9.3 (and is identical to version 2.15.5.9.3 aside from the version number); normal numbering then resumed with version 2.15.5.9.4, .5, .6 etc. following version 2.15.5.9.2 (skipping version 2.15.5.9.3, as that number was already used).</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
    <h4>Usage</h4>
        <p>Crystallize provides the following primary user-facing command-line scripts.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>crystal-search</code></dt><dd>Show the addresses of crystals that contain files (or, optionally, a maximum of one file per crystal) with path names matching the given pattern. Synopsis: <code>crystal-search [--single] [--] &lt;search-key&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>crystal-view</code></dt><dd>List the contents of the given Crystal ID. Synopsis: <code>crystal-view &lt;crystal-address&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>crystallize</code></dt><dd>Archives a snapshot of a file or files and removes it/them (unless <code>--keep</code> is specified), providing an address and/or a pointer file that can be used to retrieve it/them. <code>crystallize --update</code> is an alias for <code>crystallize-update</code>. Synopsis: <code>crystallize ( ([--version] | [--update]) | ([--leave-locked] [--keep] [--passphrase &lt;passphrase-to-use&gt;] [--] [--leave-pointer] &lt;file&gt;...) )</code></dd>
            <dt><code>crystallize-backup</code></dt><dd>Backs up <code>crystallize</code>d files with their associated metadata to the current directory. Synopsis: <code>crystallize-backup [--debug] [--passphrase &lt;passphrase-to-use&gt;] [--check-existing|--no-check-existing] [--here] [--no-recurse] &lt;crystal-address&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>decrystallize</code></dt><dd>Retrieves files stored using <code>crystallize</code> to the current directory, given their address. Synopsis: <code>decrystallize [--passphrase &lt;passphrase-to-use&gt;] [--lock-override|--no-lock-override] &lt;crystal-address&gt; [--here]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>decrystallize-pointer</code></dt><dd>Retrieves files stored using <code>crystallize</code> to the current directory, given a path to a pointer directory. Does not handle single-file pointers: use sreg_read_stream instead. Synopsis: <code>decrystallize-pointer [--passphrase &lt;passphrase-to-use&gt;] [--lock-override|--no-lock-override] &lt;path-to-pointer-directory&gt; [--here]</code></dd>
        </dl>
        <p>The following public-facing scripts are either used internally by the other tools and are mainly useful for writing other shell scripts, or are not thoroughly tested.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>crystal-bulk-backup</code></dt><dd>Backs up <code>crystallize</code>d files in bulk with their associated metadata. Will back up the Ember Library by default. Can optionally add additional things to back up: put a file for each other sreg repo (the .sreg folder, not the root) to back up in [ConfigDir]/crystallize/cbb/sreg/, a list of Crystal IDs / IA identifiers to back up in [ConfigDir]/crystallize/cbb/crystals, and a list of other git repositories to back up in [ConfigDir]/crystallize/cbb/repos. The <code>--no-update-list</code> option skips gathering crystal identifiers to back up, using an existing list, and skips updating the git repository clones; this is for resuming an interrupted backup session extra quickly, but it's better to let it update the list normally unless you know this option is what you want. The <code>--no-commit</code> option disables calling <code>git commit</code>, to work around an issue that has been appearing on macOS where running <code>git commit</code> hangs indefinitely; this option will likely be removed when the issue is resolved, and the option should not be relied upon as available. Synopsis: <code>crystal-bulk-backup [--no-check-existing] [--no-update-list] [--no-commit]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>crystallize-editconf</code></dt><dd>Open the Ember configuration file in the default editor. This is a deprecated wrapper around <code>ember-getconf</code> from <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/../ember-shared">[http://futuramerlin.com/../ember-shared]: ember-shared</a>. Synopsis: <code>crystallize-editconf</code></dd>
            <dt><code>crystallize-get-identifier-from-pointer</code></dt><dd>Print the crystal identifier for a crystal, given a path to a pointer (pointer directory, hashpointer, or other single-file pointer) for that crystal. Synopsis: <code>crystallize-get-identifier-from-pointer &lt;path-to-pointer&gt; [path-to-stream-registry-directory-for-pointer]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>crystallize-getconf</code></dt><dd>Retrieve a configuration value from the configuration file used by Ember tools. The value returned for the <code>WorkDirectory</code> option can be overridden by setting <code>EmberWorkdirOverride54ae685dc782437c99bc46c7a1211377</code> to a non-empty value. This is a deprecated wrapper around <code>ember-getconf</code> from <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/../ember-shared">[http://futuramerlin.com/../ember-shared]: ember-shared</a>. Synopsis: <code>crystallize-getconf (&lt;configuration-key-name&gt;|ConfigLocation|ConfigDir|crystallizeVersion|emberSharedVersion)</code></dd>
            <dt><code>crystallize-update</code></dt><dd>Attempt to update Crystallize. Synopsis: <code>crystallize-update</code></dd>
            <dt><code>CrystallyCopy</code></dt><dd>Copy the specified source files or directories to the destination directory. Crystallizes the source files, and outputs a <code>csum</code> file for the source files to the destination directory. Synopsis: <code>CrystallyMove &lt;source-item&gt;... &lt;destination-directory&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>CrystallyMove</code></dt><dd>Move the specified source files or directories to the destination directory.

The stream registry tools, with names prefaced by "sreg" (<em>s</em>tream <em>reg</em>istry), is a virtual file system layer that allows files to be stored as small text-based pointers that can be tracked using Git while avoiding the need to have the entire repository stored locally (the most-used data are cached locally, instead). It has some restrictions on what can be stored in it:
                <ul>

              While it is suboptimal to have these restrictions, they allowed the implementation of sreg to be simpler. Patches to fix these issues would be considered, if someone has the interest to write them (it's currently on the to-do list at <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/issue-tracker/view.php?id=587">[http://futuramerlin.com/issue-tracker/view.php?id=587]: issue #587</a>). By default, the stream registry LocalStore folder (a temporary gathering location for small files that will be stored as a batch when sreg_flush_localstore is run — it will be run occasionally automatically, and can be run manually if desired) is added to a file called <code>.gitignore</code> in the target directory, under the assumption that the stream registry will be kept in Git version control; to suppress this behavior, use the <code>--no-gitignore</code> option.

                <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ethus3h/crystallize.git</code></pre>

            <h6>Copy scripts</h6>
                <p>To install the downloaded scripts, run <code>cd crystallize; make</code>.</p>

            <h6>Setup</h6>
                <p>Edit the configuration file; see <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/#Configuration_file_format">[http://futuramerlin.com/#Configuration_file_format]: the "Configuration file format" section</a> for documentation of this.</p>

                <p>Finally, run <code>sudo make install</code>.</p>

<h3>Configuration file format</h3>
    <p>The configuration file is located in your system configuration directory (probably <code>/usr/local/etc</code> or <code>/etc</code>), and is named <code>crystallize.conf</code>. It is a list of key-value pairs in the format <code>Key,Value</code>, separated by a line feed (0x0A), as follows:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>InstallationIdentifier</dt><dd>Installation UUID</dd>
        <dt>Collection</dt><dd>Internet Archive collection identifier (write access to the collection is required)</dd>
        <dt>Passphrase</dt><dd>Passphrase (must be a valid GPG passphrase)</dd>
        <dt>WorkDirectory</dt><dd>Directory for working data (should be writeable and have sufficient free space to hold approximately three times the amount of data being crystallized at any one time). MUST NOT have newline in the path. A space in the path may cause degraded performance (see comments in <code>scache_gc</code>), and will cause failure if the part of the path name preceding the space is also a pathname that exists; ideally, don't have a space in the path.</dd>
        <dt>EmberLibrary</dt><dd>Path to a directory tree of the format used by the <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/library/">[http://futuramerlin.com/library/]: Ember Library</a></dd>
        <dt>SrfsMountpoint</dt><dd>The mountpoint to be used when <code>srfs</code> is run without one specified.</dd>
        <dt>SrfsDefaultRoot</dt><dd>An optional override for the default stream registry directory to be mounted when <code>srfs</code> is run without one specified (by default, the value of the <code>EmberLibrary</code> configuration field is used instead).</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Note that there is currently no facility for storing configuration values containing line feeds.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Code shared between various Ember software.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
    <h4>Usage</h4>
        <p>ember-shared provides the following command-line scripts, mainly useful for writing other scripts.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>csum</code></dt><dd>Generate and check against lists of file checksums. If no action is specified, <code>save</code> is assumed; if no path is specified, the current directory is assumed; if no checksum file name is specified, stdout/stdin are used for <code>save</code> and <code>check</code> respectively. Note that at least one checksummable file must be specified for the resulting file to be usable: a single empty directory, for instance, will result in an unusable file. Synopsis: <code>csum [(--save|--check)] [&lt;path&gt;... [&lt;checksum-file-name&gt;|""|-]]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>disk-size-in-bytes</code></dt><dd>Returns an estimate sum of the disk usage of the specified files, in bytes. Synopsis: <code>disk-size-in-bytes &lt;file&gt;...</code></dd>
            <dt><code>ember-editconf</code></dt><dd>Open the Ember configuration file in the default editor. Synopsis: <code>ember-editconf</code></dd>
            <dt><code>error-notify</code></dt><dd>Notify the user of a shell script of an error condition. Synopsis: <code>error-notify [exit-status] [message-to-user]...</code> (if the first argument is an integer, it is used as the exit status; otherwise error-notify exits with status 1)</dd>
            <dt><code>htmlToText.pl</code></dt><dd>Print the standard input received by it, with any HTML tags removed, to standard output. Synopsis: <code>htmlToText.pl</code></dd>
            <dt><code>warn-timeout</code></dt><dd>Notify the user of a shell script of a warning, and wait a bit in the hope that they see the warning. Synopsis: <code>warn &lt;message-to-user&gt; [time-to-wait-in-seconds]</code> (time-to-wait defaults to 10 seconds)</dd>
            <dt><code>warn</code></dt><dd>Notify the user of a shell script of a warning. Synopsis: <code>warn &lt;message-to-user&gt;</code></dd>
        </dl>
        <p>In addition, ember-shared also provides the following scripts that it uses internally that are not supported for independent use.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>a</code></dt><dd>Archive a URL recursively using <code>grab-site</code>, using a default configuration. Synopsis: <code>a [&lt;additional-grab-site-argument&lt;] &lt;url&gt;...</code></dd>
            <dt><code>abspath</code></dt><dd>Get the absolute path to the specified file or directory, like <code>readlink -f</code> but without resolving symlinks by default. Optionally, symlinks can be resolved in the path (still not resolving the final path element): this is for referencing the canonical path of a symlink without following that symlink. The path must exist. Synopsis: <code>abspath &lt;path&gt; [--resolve-symlinks-in-enclosing-directory-path]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>ap</code></dt><dd>Archive a URL recursively using <code>grab-site</code> and <code>phantomjs</code>, using a default configuration. Synopsis: <code>ap [&lt;additional-grab-site-argument&lt;] &lt;url&gt;...</code></dd>
            <dt><code>aq</code></dt><dd>Archive a URL recursively using <code>grab-site</code>, using a configuration that gives up quickly. Synopsis: <code>aq [&lt;additional-grab-site-argument&lt;] &lt;url&gt;...</code></dd>
            <dt><code>assert</code></dt><dd>Test for a condition, and report a failing status if the test fails. This is to facilitate writing readable unit tests. The <code>-v</code> makes some test types print additional information. Synopsis: <code>assert [-v] ( (directoryEquals &lt;directory-1&gt; &lt;directory-2&gt;) | (fileEquals &lt;file-1&gt; &lt;file-2&gt;) | (equals &lt;string-1&gt; &lt;string-2&gt;) | (true &lt;command&gt; [&lt;argument&gt;...]) | (false &lt;command&gt; [&lt;argument&gt;...]) | (matches_regex &lt;string&gt; &lt;regex&gt;) )</code></dd>
            <dt><code>bigSponge</code></dt><dd>Wrapper around <code>sponge</code> that uses the location provided by <code>getBigTempLocation</code> for its <code>TMPDIR</code>. Synopsis: <code>bigSponge [&lt;argument&gt;...]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>bigTempDir</code></dt><dd>Print a path to a temporary directory (in the Crystallize work directory, or another location as determined by a nonempty value of the <code>EMBER_TEMPDIR</code> variable) that can be safely deleted when you're done with it. Multiple temporary directories can be created through multiple calls to <code>bigTempDir</code>. Synopsis: <code>bigTempDir</code></dd>
            <dt><code>bigTempFile</code></dt><dd>Print a path to a temporary file (in the Crystallize work directory, or another location as determined by a nonempty value of the <code>EMBER_TEMPDIR</code> variable) that can be safely deleted when you're done with it. Multiple temporary files can be created through multiple calls to <code>bigTempFile</code>. Synopsis: <code>bigTempFile</code></dd>
            <dt><code>checkedxz</code></dt><dd>Wrapper around <code>xz</code>, to make sure the output isn't corrupt. If <code>-</code> is specified as the input file, output will be to stdout regardless of the presence or absence of <code>--stdout</code>. <code>--quiet</code> can be used to suppress the progress bars that are shown by default. Synopsis: <code>checkedxz [--quiet|--request-wait-after] [ (-|&lt;input-file&gt;) [--stdout] &lt;argument-for-xz&gt;... ]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>contains</code></dt><dd>Test whether an array contains a particular value. Synopsis: <code>contains &lt;value&gt; &lt;array-arg&gt;...</code></dd>
            <dt><code>date-uuid</code></dt><dd>Returns a timestamp combined with a random (V4) UUID. Synopsis: <code>date-uuid</code></dd>
            <dt><code>defaultEditor</code></dt><dd>Wrapper around the default text editor. Synopsis: <code>defaultEditor [&lt;argument&gt;...]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>die</code></dt><dd>Notify the user of a shell script of an error condition, and exit. Synopsis: <code>die [exit-status] [message-to-user]...</code> (if the first argument is an integer, it is used as the exit status; otherwise the script exits with status 1)</dd>
            <dt><code>die</code></dt><dd>Tells the user that their bash environment is misconfigured (this script should never run if everything is working). Synopsis: <code>die [exit-status] [message-to-user]...</code> (if the first argument is an integer, it is used as the exit status; otherwise die exits with status 1)</code></dd>
            <dt><code>eescape</code></dt><dd>Prepare a string for use as a Perl replacement match pattern (left side), used by <code>ereplace</code>. Synopsis: <code>eescape &lt;string&gt;</dd>
            <dt><code>embasename</code></dt><dd>Replacement for <code>basename</code> in bash. Synopsis: <code>embasename &lt;path&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>embasename</code></dt><dd>Replacement for <code>basename</code> in bash. Synopsis: <code>embasename &lt;path&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>ember-getconf</code></dt><dd>Retrieve a configuration value from the configuration file used by Ember tools. The value returned for the <code>WorkDirectory</code> option can be overridden by setting <code>EmberWorkdirOverride54ae685dc782437c99bc46c7a1211377</code> to a non-empty value. Synopsis: <code>ember-getconf (&lt;configuration-key-name&gt;|ConfigLocation|ConfigDir|crystallizeVersion|emberSharedVersion)</code></dd>
            <dt><code>ember_bash_setup</code></dt><dd>Set up the bash environment shared by various Ember projects. To use the <code>--version</code> option of <code>ember_bash_setup</code>, it is necessary to have <code>e8787d06e61943a6874e94985b53bc0a="2dee41bf-53fb-4f65-997f-33bf50bfbb4d"</code> when running <code>ember_bash_setup --version</code>. It may be important to run <code>unset e8787d06e61943a6874e94985b53bc0a</code> afterwards. Using bash's <code>$()</code>syntax (which creates a subshell), it can be written succinctly, with no need to <code>unset</code> afterwards, as <code>$(e8787d06e61943a6874e94985b53bc0a="2dee41bf-53fb-4f65-997f-33bf50bfbb4d"; ember_bash_setup --version)</code>. (Note that if ember_bash_setup has already been sourced, the ember-shared version is already available as <code>$emberSharedVersion</code>, with no need for these shenanigans.) Synopsis: <code>(source ember_bash_setup) | (ember_bash_setup --version)</code></dd>
            <dt><code>emdate</code></dt><dd>Returns a timestamp. Synopsis: <code>emdate</code></dd>
            <dt><code>emreadlink</code></dt><dd>Alias for <code>abspath</code> with the <code>--resolve-symlinks-in-enclosing-directory-path</code> option. Synopsis: <code>emreadlink &lt;path&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>ereplace</code></dt><dd>Replace one string with another ie n the specified file (without interpreting metacharacters). Synopsis: <code>ereplace &lt;string-to-replace&gt; &lt;replacement-string&gt; &lt;file&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>ereplaceRegEx</code></dt><dd>Perform a Perl regex substitution on the specified file (interpreting metacharacters). The match and replacement must be a valid within a <code>s///g</code> in Perl (it will be literally interpolated into the Perl code, rather than escaped as it is with <code>ereplace</code>). Synopsis: <code>ereplaceRegEx &lt;regex-match&gt; &lt;replacement&gt; &lt;file&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>findso</code></dt><dd>Given the file name of a <code>.so</code> shared library, print the full path to it. The <code>--plain</code> option indicates that the library name is in the form <code>libfoo.so</code>, while by default it assumes that the form <code>foo</code> is used. Synopsis: <code>findso [--plain] &lt;library-name&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>firefox-places-build</code></dt><dd>FIXME: Restored places.sqlite doesn't work.

Synopsis: <code>firefox-places-build</code></dd>
            <dt><code>firefox-places-dump</code></dt><dd>FIXME: Restored places.sqlite doesn't work. Save the current user's Firefox <code>places.sqlite</code> and <code>sessionstore.js</code> to <code>firefox-places-dump.sql</code>, <code>firefox-places-dump.schema.sql</code>, and <code>firefox-places-dump.sessionstore.js</code> in the current directory (or optionally, the <code>places.sqlite</code> and <code>sessionstore.js</code> in the specified directory). The files have a newline as every other character, so they can be easily diffed by git for smaller snapshot storage. "Reversing" (using <code>firefox-places-build</code>) this should <em>not</em> be assumed to produce the input bit-for-bit. Synopsis: <code>firefox-places-dump [&lt;path-to-profile-directory&gt;]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>get-default-firefox-profile</code></dt><dd>Print the path of the default Firefox profile in <code>.mozilla/firefox</code> in the current user's home directory (or else in a directory containing profiles specified by an optional argument, such as <code>/home/someoneelse/.mozilla/firefox</code>). Synopsis: <code>get-default-firefox-profile [&lt;path-to-profiles-directory&gt;]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>flacToWaveform</code></dt><dd>Generate a .png waveform file in a manner compatible with the Internet Archive's derivative process. Synopsis: <code>flacToWaveform &lt;path-to-input-file.flac&gt;</code></dd>

            <dt><code>getBigTempLocation</code></dt><dd>Print the path to the Crystallize work directory, or another location as determined by a nonempty value of the <code>EMBER_TEMPDIR</code> variable, or failing those, the system's general preferred temporary file location. Synopsis: <code>getBigTempLocation</code></dd>
            <dt><code>getDefaultEditor</code></dt><dd>Returns the command of the default text editor. Synopsis: <code>getDefaultEditor</code></dd>
            <dt><code>getDefaultEditorPath</code></dt><dd>Returns a path to the default text editor. Synopsis: <code>getDefaultEditorPath</code></dd>
            <dt><code>getGrabSiteGrabLocation</code></dt><dd>Returns the default directory for <code>grab-site</code> grabs to go into. Note that if <code>$HOME/gs-grabs</code> exists and <code>.grab-site-grabs</code> in the system work directory does not exist, the former will be used, instead of the latter, which is otherwise the default. Synopsis: <code>getGrabSiteGrabLocation</code></dd>
            <dt><code>getGrabSitePath</code></dt><dd>Returns the path of the <code>grab-site</code> command, even if it is not in <code>$PATH</code>. Synopsis: <code>getGrabSitePath</code></dd>

            <dt><code>ia</code></dt><dd>Wrapper around the <code>ia</code> tool for communicating with the Internet Archive, which can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard <code>ia</code> command. Using the <code>downloadAsStream</code> subcommand will send the contents of the file represented by the Internet Archive file download URL specified to stdout. <code>checkeddl</code> accepts an Internet Archive item details URL or plain identifier as input. The <code>downloadHere</code> subcommand is equivalent to <code>wget &lt;URL&gt;</code> for Internet Archive download URLs. Synopsis: <code>ia [ ((downloadAsStream|downloadHere) &lt;URL&gt;) | (checkeddl &lt;URL&gt;...) | (listplain &lt;identifier&gt;) | ([argument]...) ]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>iafilename</code></dt><dd>Given an Internet Archive URL, path (with identifier), or plain identifier in the form <code>[https://archive.org/download/]identifier[/file/path]</code>, return the name of the last item in the path specified within the item specified.

Right now, because item files XMLs do not have checksums available for them from the Internet Archive (since the XML files are where the checksums are kept), <code>iamd5</code> will retrieve it and calculate the checksum dynamically. <em>This could be suboptimal (or even harmful) since there is no guarantee that the returned value is correct; this behavior may change in later versions</em>. Synopsis: <code>iamd5 &lt;input&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>iapath</code></dt><dd>Given an Internet Archive URL, path (with identifier), or plain identifier in the form <code>[https://archive.org/download/]identifier[/file/path]</code>, return the path to the item (not including the identifier).

Right now, because item files XMLs do not have checksums available for them from the Internet Archive (since the XML files are where the checksums are kept), <code>iasha1</code> will retrieve it and calculate the checksum dynamically. <em>This could be suboptimal (or even harmful) since there is no guarantee that the returned value is correct; this behavior may change in later versions</em>. Synopsis: <code>iasha1 &lt;input&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>iaurl</code></dt><dd>Given an Internet Archive URL, path (with identifier), or plain identifier in the form <code>[https://archive.org/download/]identifier[/file/path]</code>, return the full URL. For the example URL, this would return "<code>https://archive.org/download/identifier/file/path</code>". Synopsis: <code>iaurl &lt;input&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>invertReturnValue</code></dt><dd>Returns 1 if the command returns true, or 0 if it returns false. Synopsis: <code>invertReturnValue &lt;command&gt; [&lt;argument&gt;...]</code></dd>
            <dt><code>isEmptyDir</code></dt><dd>Exits with exit code 0 if the path specified is an empty directory, and 1 otherwise (including if the path does not exist). Synopsis: <code>isEmptyDir &lt;path&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>isIaName</code></dt><dd>Given a string, exit 0 if it could be an Internet Archive URL, path, or identifier in the form <code>[https://archive.org/download/]identifier[/file/path]</code>; otherwise exit 1. Synopsis: <code>isIaName &lt;input&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>isSubdirOf</code></dt><dd>Exits 0 if the second argument is a subdirectory of the first argument (but not if they are the same directory). Synopsis: <code>isSubdirOf &lt;possible-enclosing-directory&gt; &lt;possible-subdirectory&gt;</code></dd>
            <dt><code>newline-terminated-characters-from-text</code></dt><dd>Place a newline after each character in the text file sent to standard input, and send the result to standard output. Does not work on files with nulls in them, and probably not on other things that aren't normal text files either. Synopsis: <code>newline-terminated-characters-from-text</code></dd>

        <dl>
            <dt>common</dt><dd>Components shared between the other themes.</dd>
            <dt>ember</dt><dd>A fancy theme designed to look like the default theme in version 7r2 of the Wreathe GNU/Linux distribution. This is the theme that was formerly used for the Ember project Web site. Despite the name, it is no longer currently used for that (the "simple" theme is used instead), and isn't actively maintained. WARNING: This theme has a bug in the CSS that causes it to malfunction badly when pages using it are viewed in Netscape 6–era Web browsers, causing the Web site to be unusable as the navigation menu fills the entire viewport.</dd>
            <dt>m</dt><dd>Alias for the "ember" theme.</dd>
            <dt>simple</dt><dd>A simple black-and-white theme. This is the theme used for the Ember project Web site.</dd>
        </dl>

    <h4>Ebook configuration</h4>
        <p>Each line consists of a "depth", followed by a space, followed by the line's contents. The line may be preceded by whitespace without breaking anything, allowing for nicely formatted files. The depth can be any of the following values:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>#</dt><dd>Comment</dd>
            <dt>Integers -1+</dt><dd>Include the specified path, adjusting its headings by the number of depth levels given. The path may be a path without extension to a .htm file in the Web toolkit's expected fragment format, or the path to a directory ending in / containing a file index.htm in the usual format, or the path with or without extension of another ebook configuration file. If the level -1 is given, headings at the top level will be removed (but any text within them will remain); this is intended for use with a file with a single &lt;h2&gt; header which is desired to be a top-level part of a book.</dd>
            <dt>-2</dt><dd>A path without extension of a file present with the extension of the native target output format(s), of which to include the contents literally. (For example, if you want the file included for the htm and plain.html output formats of the book, and your configuration line is "<code>-2 book-assets/include-me</code>", the files book-assets/include-me.htm and book-assets/include-me.plain.html need to exist.)</dd>
            <dt>-3</dt><dd>A heading to include literally, like "<code>&lt;h3&gt;Heading Text&lt;/h3&gt;</code>". (It will be adjusted as needed if the book is included in another book.)</dd>
            <dt>-4</dt><dd>Used as the first line of a configuration file to define the book title, e.g. "<code>-4 Book Title</code>"</dd>
        </dl>

    <h4>Configuration file format</h4>
        <p>The configuration file is located at <code>~/.futuramerlin-web-toolkit.cfg</code>. It contains configuration values separated by a line feed (0x0A), as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name for the Web site</li>
            <li>"<code>disableLocalInstallation</code>" to disable installing the CSS file for local browsing, or "<code>enableLocalInstallation</code>" to enable it (any other value will be treated as "<code>disableLocalInstallation</code>")</li>
            <li>Installation time</li>
            <li>Installation UUID</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that there is currently no facility for storing configuration values containing line feeds.</p>

                        <li>Git</li>
                        <li>Python 3, runnable as <code>python3</code></li>
                        <li>Tornado</li>
                        <li>python-dateutil</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you have a version of Warcdealer prior to version 3 installed, remove it.</li>
                <li>Figure out as what user Warcdealer should run. If you're using grab-site, this is either the user as which grab-site is running, or <code>root</code>. Otherwise, this is any user with write permission for the files you would like to upload. (<code>root</code> will work in either case.) When you have selected the correct user, substitute it in place of "<code>userName</code>" in the following command, and run the resulting command (note that output beginning with "<code>mv: cannot stat</code>" can be safely ignored):<br /><pre><code>mv ~/.warcdealer.cfg ~/.warcdealer.bak; echo "userName" > ~/.warcdealer.cfg</code></pre></li>
                <li>Decide at what threshold of free disk space, in gigabytes, you would like uploads to begin. A reasonable default for large disks is "<code>80</code>". When you have decided this, substitute that number in place of "<code>diskThreshold</code>" in the following command, and run the resulting command:<br /><pre><code>echo "diskThreshold" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg</code></pre></li>
                <li>Figure out what partition you would like to monitor for free disk space (<span class="foreign-text">e. g.</span> <code>/</code> for the root partition). When you know this, substitute it in place of "<code>diskMonitorPartition</code>" in the following command, and run the resulting command:<br /><pre><code>echo "diskMonitorPartition" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg</code></pre></li>
                <li>Decide how frequently, in seconds, you want the free disk space to be checked. A reasonable default is "<code>60</code>". When you have decided this, substitute it in place of "diskCheckInterval" in the following command, and run the resulting command:<br /><pre><code>echo "diskCheckInterval" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg</code></pre></li>
                <li>Figure out to which collection at the Internet Archive you want to upload (upload permission to the collection is necessary). If you don't know otherwise, this should be "<code>opensource</code>". When you have figured this out, substitute it in place of "destinationCollection" in the following command, and run the resulting command:<br /><pre><code>echo "destinationCollection" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg</code></pre></li>
                <li>If you want to disable the archive index feature, run the following command:<br /><pre><code>echo "disableArchiveIndex" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg; set +H</code></pre><br />Otherwise, run the following command:<br /><pre><code>echo "enableArchiveIndex" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg; set +H</code></pre></li>
                <li>As the user you chose in step 2, run the following command:<br /><!-- TODO: update the line of the config file to look for the UUID in --><pre><code>warcdealerPreInstallPath=$(pwd); echo "enableWARCBundling" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg; echo "disableRemoteJobControl" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg; warcdealerInstallationUUID=$(python2 -c 'import uuid; print str(uuid.uuid4())'); oldWarcdealerInstallationUUID=$(sed '7q;d' "$HOME"/.warcdealer.cfg); warcdealerUUIDRegex='^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[4][0-9a-f]{3}-[89ab][0-9a-f]{3}-[0-9a-f]{12}$'; if [[ $oldWarcdealerInstallationUUID =~ $warcdealerUUIDRegex ]]; then warcdealerInstallationUUID="$oldWarcdealerInstallationUUID"; fi; cd ~; mkdir "$warcdealerInstallationUUID"; cd "$warcdealerInstallationUUID"; git clone https://github.com/ethus3h/warcdealer.git; mkdir -p ~/.warcdealer/pending/multiseed; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer ~/.warcdealers; chmod +x ~/.warcdealers; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer-ia-upload ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer-ia-upload-split ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload-split; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload-split; cp -f ./warcdealer/JobControlAPI.php ~/.warcdealer/JobControlApi.php; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer/JobControlApi.php; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer-aliases ~/.warcdealer-aliases; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer-aliases; cp -f ./warcdealer/viewer.patch ~/.warcdealer-viewer.patch; echo $(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S-%N)-$(xxd -pu &lt;&lt;&lt; "$(date +%z)") >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg; echo "$warcdealerInstallationUUID" >> ~/.warcdealer.cfg; echo "#"'!'"/bin/bash" >> ~/.bash_profile; echo ". ~/.warcdealer-aliases" >> ~/.bash_profile; echo "#"'!'"/bin/bash" >> ~/.bashrc; echo ". ~/.bash_profile" >> ~/.bashrc; chmod +x ~/.bash_profile; chmod +x ~/.bashrc; cd ..; rm -r ./"$warcdealerInstallationUUID"; cd "$warcdealerPreInstallPath"</code></pre></li>
                <li>Choose a passphrase. When you have chosen one, substitute it in place of "passPhrase" in the following command, and run the resulting command:<br /><pre><code>perl -0777 -p -i -e "s/ThisIsntEvenMyFinalPassword/$passPhrase/g" ~/.warcdealer/JobControlAPI.php</code></pre></li>
                <li>Log out and log in again, to update your shell aliases.</li>
            </ol>

    <h4>Updating</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Check for changes to the requirements.</li>
            <li>Check the Warcdealer version. If the major version has changed, or <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/release-notes.htm">[http://futuramerlin.com/release-notes.htm]: the release notes</a> specify that it should be reinstalled since the version you have installed, (the part before the first "." in the version number), follow the current installation instructions instead (unless you know you don't need to, <span class="foreign-text">e. g.</span> if the release notes specify that the configuration file format is compatible with the major version you have installed).</li>
            <li>As the user you chose in step 2 of the installation process, run the following command:<br /><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.warcdealer/pending/multiseed; warcdealerPreInstallPath=$(pwd); warcdealerTemporaryUUID=$(python2 -c 'import uuid; print str(uuid.uuid4())'); cd ~; mkdir "$warcdealerTemporaryUUID"; cd "$warcdealerTemporaryUUID"; git clone https://github.com/ethus3h/ember.git; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer ~/.warcdealers; chmod +x ~/.warcdealers; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer-ia-upload ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer-ia-upload-split ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload-split; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer-ia-upload-split; cp -f ./warcdealer/JobControlAPI.php ~/.warcdealer/JobControlApi.php; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer/JobControlApi.php; cp -f ./warcdealer/warcdealer-aliases ~/.warcdealer-aliases; chmod +x ~/.warcdealer-aliases; cp -f ./warcdealer/viewer.patch ~/.warcdealer-viewer.patch; cd ..; rm -r ./"$warcdealerTemporaryUUID"; cd "$warcdealerPreInstallPath"</code></pre></li>
        </ol>

    <h4>Configuration file format</h4>
        <p><span class="hatnote-emphasis-warning">Be careful when manually editing the configuration file. Specifically, do <b>NOT</b> use the "<code>disableWARCBundling</code>" option unless you know what you are doing.</span></p>
        <p>The configuration file is located at <code>~/.warcdealer.cfg</code>. It contains configuration values separated by a line feed (0x0A), as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name of user as which Warcdealer should run</li>
            <li>Amount of free space in gigabytes below which WARC files should be uploaded and crawls should be paused</li>
            <li>Delay in seconds between disk space checks</li>
            <li>Internet Archive target collection identifier</li>
            <li>"<code>disableArchiveIndex</code>" to disable the archive search tool, or "<code>enableArchiveIndex</code>" to enable it (any other value will be treated as "<code>enableArchiveIndex</code>")</li>
            <li>"<code>disableWARCBundling</code>" to upload each file as a separate item, or "<code>enableWARCBundling</code>" to enable it (any other value will be treated as "<code>enableWARCBundling</code>")</li>
            <li>"<code>enableRemoteJobControl</code>" to enable remote job control (probably not secure), or "<code>disableRemoteJobControl</code>" to disable it (any other value will be treated as "<code>disableRemoteJobControl</code>")</li>
            <li>Installation time</li>
            <li>Installation UUID</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that there is currently no facility for storing configuration values containing line feeds.</p>

<h3>BeHeMMOth</h3>


<h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>A bullet-hell computer game with support for multiple players over the Web. It is a fork of Fabiano, and consequently is licensed under the AGPL3.</p>

    <p><span class="hatnote-emphasis-warning">The client is not yet confirmed to work without non-libre dependencies (it so far has only been successfully tested with Adobe Flash and the freshplayerplugin wrapper). Resolving this issue is a high priority. In addition, some of the "source code" for the project is actually binary blobs, due to the inclusion of precompiled dependencies and such; eliminating those is another high priority.</span></p>

<h4>Documentation</h4>

    <h5>Usage</h5>
        <h6>Client</h6>
            <h7>Syntax</h7>
                <figure class="center-figure app-syntax">
                    <code>behemmoth_client</code>
                </figure>
        <h6>Server</h6>
            <h7>Syntax</h7>
                <figure class="center-figure app-syntax">
                    <code>behemmoth_server</code>
                </figure>

    <h5>Installation</h5>
        <p>For Wreathe 7.3 and similar operating systems (e.g. Gentoo GNU/Linux), an ebuild (<code>games-roguelike/behemmoth</code>) is available in the <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/ancillary/wreathe">[http://futuramerlin.com/ancillary/wreathe]: Wreathe</a> overlay.</p>
        <p>For other operating systems, use the following installation instructions.</p>

        <h6>Download</h6>
            <p>To download BeHeMMOth, run:</p>
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ethus3h/BeHeMMOth.git</code></pre>
        <h6>Requirements</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>See the ebuild for details.</li>
            </ul>
        <h6>Compilation</h6>
            <p><code>cd</code> into the source code directory, and run <code>make</code>.</p>
        <h6>Installation</h6>
            <p>Run <code>sudo make install</code>.</p>

    <h5>Troubleshooting</h5>
        <p>If the client gives a "Error loading language" error, it was probably unable to connect to the server. Make sure the server is accessible to the client. If the client just gives a black screen, the language file (e.g. <code>en.txt</code>) probably has an incorrect syntax (it must be a UTF-8 file in the form <code>[["key1", "value", "languageAbbreviation"], ["key2", "value", "languageAbbreviation"]]</code> with a byte order mark at the beginning; incorrect whitespace (e.g. newlines) or use of commas will probably cause problems). If the client says "Loading..." on a grey background on a black screen, make sure it has been added to the Adobe Flash trust list ("Global Settings" in the context menu). If when you try to enter a realm or the Nexus it takes a long time, just give it a minute; it may say "Socket-Server Security Error: Error #2048" and "Connection failed! Retrying...": this is <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/issue-tracker/view.php?id=528">[http://futuramerlin.com/issue-tracker/view.php?id=528]: a known issue</a> but doesn't seem to adversely affect use of the software.</p>

<h3>wreathe-file-manager</h3>


<h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>This project is to provide a file manager app for Wreathe, as currently available options are not sufficient.</p>
    <p>There are three avenues for attempting to implement this. One, used so far, is maintaining ebuild for Dolphin 4.7. This is impractical due to the increasing requirement of older version of libraries (poppler,dbusmenu). Second, attempt to implement miller columns in current Dolphin. This is a lot of work, although I have started on it somewhat in branch <code>wreathe/implement-miller-columns-on-current</code>. Ultimately, it would be the best strategy. Third, attempt to port Dolphin 4.7 to KF5. This is also difficult, although I have started on it somewhat in branch <code>wreathe/kf5-port</code>. Back to maintaining the old ebuild it is.</p>
    <p>Version 4.11 uses Nepomuk 2.</p>

<code>macro_bool_to_01(Nepomuk_FOUND HAVE_NEPOMUK)</code> becomes
<code>
if(Nepomuk_FOUND)
    set(HAVE_NEPOMUK 1)
else()
    set(HAVE_NEPOMUK 0)
endif()
</code>
