<h1>Responses to <em>Designing Mindfulness</em></h1>

<p>This article discusses the incorporating of consideration of a user's wellness in the development of "attentional, non-explicit products" (p. 11), particularly through <em>mindfulness</em>.</p>
<p>Questions:
    <ul>
        <li>The article posits a "mind-training loop" of commercial software and Web design in which "the user's attention is being directed and changed" by the design, such as through directing users to interact with advertizements or make purchases. Isn't this also present in pretty much any interaction between a person and a corporation that is trying to manipulate them (such as through the placement of items in a store to encourage their sale)?</li>
        <li>The article proposes being "honest about dark patterns" (p. 22â€“23) and using them only "with intention and awareness of their impact". Because dark patterns are inherently dishonest, isn't this contradicting itself? (Maybe they mean to replace them with direct communication with the users?)</li>
        <li>The article suggests discouraging "addictive usage", implying that it will reduce profit in the long term. Isn't it better for business, but still harmful to users, to design for addiction that is sustainable over the long term, by not escalating over a dull roar of addiction? What business rationale would there be to eliminate addictive usage?</li>
    </ul>
</p>
