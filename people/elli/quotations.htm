I will say, as a trans man, since I transitioned I've felt people are much less willing to accept my emotions. Especially after going to a liberal arts college. I felt like people were constantly like, "Men need to start expressing their emotions!!!" And then as soon as you do you're the immature and babyish one.

ALSO, follow up, I think one of the difficulties of men connecting with each other is emotional connection is painted as weak now. Men feel like they can only emotionally connect with women while their guy friends are people they only really shoot the shit with. Then, when said woman friend doesn't want to be more, they become angry because they are so afraid of losing the one emotional connection they had. A generalization, but I think this happens a lot.
