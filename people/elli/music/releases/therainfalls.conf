note,Note 2019m04d16a17: I don't recall whether the ellipsis in the release name is ideally intended to be a single character "<span style="font-family: anoeyfuturamerlincommedium,AnoeyFuturamerlincom;">¹</span>", or the pair of Unicode characters "⋯⋯". The same concern applies to taitoep, where I used a single character in one place in the old discography, and two characters in another. I vaguely recall that it was intended to be a single character for taitoep, and that the pair of characters was just a hack for visual approximation, but I'm not sure if I intended to carry that over to this release as well. It seems plausible that I did, so am using a single character here as well. The pair of characters is used in the file metadata, though, so this is debatable. Note 2019m04d16a17n2: OGG and MP3 transcodes were made 2019m04d16a17 using Sound Converter 3.0.0-beta1. Note 2020m4d21: There's a mystery release with the mojibake title "éãâ¯â¯ï¡áï¡â¯â¯ãèŸéã?" in some versions of my discography, listed immediately after this one. That appears to be (a fragment of the title of) this release: it's "�』⋯⋯���⋯⋯『� ��?�" when assumed to be UTF-8 misinterpreted as ISO-8859-1 (although either that's not quite right, or it's been mangled somehow (perhaps through the loss of control characters, given all those replacement characters) — I suspect it's actually UTF-8 misinterpreted as the AlphaSmart Neo character set (or perhaps Mac OS Roman), but don't have an easy way to check).
