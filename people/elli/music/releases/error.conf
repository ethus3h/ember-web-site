note,Note 2020m4d20: The album art has the title typeset as "error!". I'm not sure whether that typesetting was intended to be part of the title, or whether it should just be "Error" as the title. The duration is from 2623.html in music-sources (MusicBrainz says 21m44s). Originally had no catalog number. The 2715.zip file is from the Web site. FIXME: Needs a new CD rip (a proper one with multiple passes and everything). I'm pretty sure Mirage is spelled Miirage on the artwork (don't have it handy right now); if so I'm pretty sure it was a typo in the artwork (although I think I may have reused that typo deliberately later). Was Alokhi track 3 (with the release having 9 tracks, and the remainder being offset by one starting with Betrayal--016 as track 4) or was it absent? It's included in the ZIP file, but I wrote on MusicBrainz "fixes. alokhi was a screwup on the artwork." on 7 June 2010 and removed that track.
