note,Note 2019apr5a6: I previously had "(like 99% sure this is where it was, as of 4 April 2019)" in the location field, but it occurs to me that I was listening to the sounds I made, and I have not listened to music other than through headphones recently, and have not used the headphones I have for at school (Work Tunes) recently, so by necessity I must have been at 61 Taylor Road, since that's where the only headphones I've used recently (V-Moda M100) are.
