<p>This page documents notes from the process of compiling the music Web site.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous observations</h2>

    <p>I don't think the thumbnail images or IA derivative files are really part of the releases, so they are not linked from the release page (except for MP3/OGA/FLAC transcodes). They all will be saved by crystallize-backup, though.</p>

    <p>Not every session has a file representing its product, or a work version, since it might just be a commit in the git repository or something.</p>

    <p>Empty config values I think will be treated as undefined, even if given in the file. An empty HTML comment as the value I think would produce an empty value if desired, although it might result in an empty link or other important navigational element. I've not implemented any solution for this yet, as it is only a hypothetical problem (I don't have any tracks that are supposed to have an empty name).</p>

    <p>The artwork PNG files for Youtube releases are made from the thumbnail file saved by <code>youtube-dl</code>.</p>

    <p>Only a few reference types (that look up information from a .conf file) are implemented (context, work, artist, etc.).</p>

    <p>For the "label" attribute of artists, I've supplied the most recent label. Look at releases for more comprehensive label information.</p>

    <p>The "dateComposed" of tracks until at least 2010, and probably some after then, is

<h2>To do</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fix players for work pages</li>
        <li>Support artist credits better for release? Perhaps like: Artist: Whoever and Somebody feat. Anyone</li>
        <li>Link file downloads from track (work-version) pages. This will require looking in the context of the item to retrieve the identifier to build the link.</li>
        <li>Hide category links on discography page for categories with no content</li>
        <li>Automatically build player tables for works and sessions</li>
        <li>Video players</li>
        <li>Automatically build artists list for labels</li>
        <li>List work versions on artist pages</li>
        <li>Add a new field type for info to be added outside of a table (close the current table before it, and don't open a new one after it unless needed)</li>
        <li>Automatically include aliases in artist info table: don't require isAliasOf</li>
        <li>Include date of first release (or of completion? or of begun?) of works on the works index page?</li>
        <li>Remember volume setting between sessions using a cookie</li>
        <li>Continue playing between pages</li>
        <li>Featured releases page doesn't work on mobile, and doesn't work if CSS is enabled but JavaScript is disabled.</li>
    </ul>
