Modification or commercial use of this content is strictly forbidden.<br>
How the switched é/e in Anoé text is handled: All text is in such a
manner that it displays as it does in the album artwork, even if that
is not correct Anoé. This typographical issue is not corrected from
album artwork to transcription here, rather the original is left
intact. Note that the Internet Archive item identifier for
"Itfaen-atél-eselit" (itfaén-atel-ésélit properly) does correct the
error as of 1 September 2013, although that may be changed.<br>
