<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factory farming is “a system of rearing livestock using intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions”<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/factory+farming">[1]</a></sup>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a factory farm, livestock are often kept in cages or pens in which they are unable to move freely or, sometimes, stand. The workers at a West Virginia slaughterhouse that is run by a company named Pilgrim's Pride are sometimes unable to place the birds on a chain to be slaughtered with sufficient speed. A 2004 video filmed by an activist showed that “instead of attaching them to the overhead chain, workers would throw leftover birds against the wall. [...] One worker put three live chickens on the floor and jumped on each of them. ‘I like to hear the popping sound they make,’ said the worker”<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Chew-This-Everything-Dont-About/dp/0618710310">[2]</a></sup>. Lack of oversight, and mismanagement of the slaughterhouses contribute to this abuse of the livestock.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fast-food industry supports factory farms because they are a source of inexpensive meat. Consumers indirectly patronize the factory farms by purchasing food from the fast-food restaurants.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The livestock industry, as a whole, “is responsible for nearly 20 percent of the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere worldwide”<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.heifer.org/site/c.edJRKQNiFiG/b.4172985/">[3]</a></sup>. Greenhouse gases, such as methane, which is released from decomposing manure, are the primary cause of global warming, a major threat to the environment. It likely will cause a major rise in ocean level, thereby flooding costal communities, leading to overpopulation of inland regions. It can cause major change in climate, leading to the rendering of habitat unlivable for its native species, and to the extinction thereof.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many water supplies, on which citizens of nearby communities rely, have been polluted by runoff from the extreme concentration of excrement produced by factory farming. In the fall of 2004, “a 4-million-pound, 30-foot-high pile of manure started to burn. Spraying a lot of water on it threatened to pollute nearby streams”<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Chew-This-Everything-Dont-About/dp/0618710310">[2]</a></sup>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because factory farms are capable of producing meat at a relatively low unit cost, the previously ubiquitous, significantly smaller, family-owned farms, unable to compete financially, are being forced to close, disrupting communities and reducing the security of the nation's food supply.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of oversight and excessive speed of the lines in slaughterhouses can lead to fecal contamination of the meat. This can lead to outbreaks of mutant strains of Escherichia coli. Some strains of this can create Shiga toxins, causing hemorrhagic colitis. One such strain, O157:H7, is one of the most common strains; the most probable number of E. coli O157:H7 is 67 organisms per uncooked patty<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FRPubs/00-023N/00-023NReport.pdf">[4]</a></sup>. From the mixing of many animals' meat, “a single animal infected with E. coli O157:H7 can contaminate thirty-two thousand pounds of ground beef”<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Chew-This-Everything-Dont-About/dp/0618710310">[2]</a></sup>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A European country recently had to burn many livestock due to an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which is caused by the addition of livestock, their blood, and returned meat from the supermarkets into the feed, which is then fed to the livestock. This same-species eating can cause significant health issues, as eating meat from animals suffering from BSE can spread the disease to the consumer. The livestock in factory farms are nearly always fed inorganic, unhealthy feed consisting mainly of grains, which the livestock are not intended to eat. They are intended to eat grasses, because they are ruminants.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the lack of sufficient space in factory farms, the livestock develop diseases easily, warranting the use of vast quantities of antibiotics for their control. “This overuse of antibiotics creates super-strains of disease-resistant germs”<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.themeatrix.com/">[5]</a></sup>. These bacteria then pose significant problems for hospitals if they infect the patients' wounds, as the bacteria's resistance renders antibiotics ineffective.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers at slaughterhouses have very little health care and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rights. The workers are sometimes illegal, often poorly-treated immigrants. Sufficient oversight or training are not provided for the workers, which can lead to their injury. The required OSHA inspections are very minimal: legislation permits them to be conducted by plant managers. The inspectors regularly maintain two sets of records: one for the parent corporation and one for the purpose of misleading OSHA.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One method for correcting the issue of factory farming using policy would be to create legislation mandating periodic inspections performed by OSHA inspectors. Currently, OSHA inspections are grossly mismanaged — they are performed by employees of the meatpacking corporations, some of whom regularly falsify inspection data. Some of the advantages of this legislation are that it would protect the workers and their rights, and that lessened line speeds would reduce the stress on the livestock. The disadvantage is that it might not be well-enforced due to the meatpacking industry's vast political power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible remedy using direct action would be to initiate a pro-livestock-rights group that would attempt to educate the public on the issues surrounding factory farming and act to remedy the problems of factory farming. One advantage of this method is that it would likely spread knowledge in consumers, thereby reducing the number of consumers who would purchase food from restaurants that use factory-farmed food, lessening the corporations' profits. One disadvantage is that it may not seem an appealing or “cool” activity to the restaurants' customers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A method for raising consumer awareness concerning this issue would be to provide posters and create Public Service Announcements (PSAs) describing the harmful practices pertaining to factory farming and explaining methods consumers could use to combat these issues, such as demonstrations, boycotts, and petitions. One advantage of this method is that it would provide consumers knowledge of how they could combat this issue. One disadvantage is that consumers may not act on these proposals; however, some would.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factory farming contributes to livestock abuse, global warming, pollution, loss of family-owned farms, E. coli outbreaks, BSE, antibiotic-resistant strains of harmful bacteria, and the abuse of workers. </td>
