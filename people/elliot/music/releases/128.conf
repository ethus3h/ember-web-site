note,At least four errors seem to be present in the track list: 1) The instrumentation of track 5, "Sylvan Fantasy" is listed as "Synthesizer, Vocals" when (as far as I recall) it is only synthesizer, 2) track 11,  "Untitled", is listed as track 10 in one listing, 3) the instrumentation of track 6, "Later (Remix)", is listed as "Vocals" when (compare to, for example, the listing on the "Later (Remix)" single artwork) it seems to be only synthesizer, and 4) the duration of track 8, "Clavichord Solo" is listed as "6.32", it seems to be 1.56 (compare to, for example, the listing on the "Sylvan Fantasy" artwork). Note 2019m04d5a6: Presumably the 3014.zip version is a revised version of the 2995.zip version. I have not yet inspected the differences between them.
