The AVIs (as of 2018aug17, not yet srsynced into personal) are attempts of practicing it. The remaining files were made to listen to repeatedly for getting the tempo of the fast bit in my ear for trying to play it (the one with "KWave" in the name was the final one I used for that). (I'm pretty much entirely sure the dates saying "2018aug06" for the files listed here are just wrong.)
