Importance of Reputation, as embodied in <u>Much Ado About Nothing</u>.
</h2>
<p>
Love has the ability to make some appear to be fools. Benedick and Claudio discuss their loves. They argue. Their doing so does not contribute to their appearing to be intelligent. "I noted her not; but I looked on her." This quote demonstrates some of the foolishness that love can inadvertently  cause, as they are lovers, but neither knows that the other so. Beatrice and Benedick love mutually, and do not act in an optimal fashion, as they bicker, rather than express any affection whatsoever. This demonstrates how love can have adverse repercussions on the subjects' apparent intelligence. "BENEDICK Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none. BEATRICE A dear happiness to women: they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me."
