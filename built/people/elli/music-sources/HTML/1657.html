Livestock Abuse.
</h3>
<p>
The livestock are often kept in cages or pens in which they are unable to move freely or stand. The workers at a slaughterhouse in West Virginia, run by a company named Pilgrim's Pride, sometimes are unable to place the birds on a chain to be slaughtered as quickly as they arrive. A 2004 video shot by an activist shows that “instead of attaching them to the overhead chain, workers would throw leftover birds against the wall”[11]. “One worker put three live chickens on the floor and jumped on each of them. “I like to hear the popping sound they make,” said the worker”[11]. This abuse of the livestock is caused by lack of oversight, and mismanagement of the slaughterhouses.
