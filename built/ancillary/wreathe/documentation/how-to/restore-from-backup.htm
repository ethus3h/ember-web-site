Configure it to save backups to a destination on the same device as your backups to restore.

(To open a file manager with root permissions in Wreathe 4+, run:<br><br> <pre><code>gksu dolphin</code></pre><br><br> .) Look at the directory naming pattern of the new snapshot, and change your existing snapshot directory names to match this convention if necessary (e. g. one version has a three-digits-after-a-hyphen suffix on the folder names that another does not; without adjusting the directory names the other version will not recognize these snapshots).</li> <li>Click Refresh Snapshots in the Back In Time interface.</li> <li>Assuming the desired snapshots showed up correctly (if it didn't, something went wrong), replace the trivial item added in step 2 with your desired backup target to the list of items to back up. Save your settings.</li> <li>Delete the new trivial-item snapshot (unless you want it for some reason). (This is to make sure that any new snapshots in this same directory are diffed with the last full snapshot, rather than the trivial-item snapshot, so as to avoid duplication. I'm not sure that it would result in duplication though, that's just an assumption I'm making.)</li> <li>Select the snapshot from which you would like to restore from the column in the left.</li> <li>Restore files and/or directories as desired by right clicking on the item and choosing Restore.</li> </ol> </main> </body> </html>
