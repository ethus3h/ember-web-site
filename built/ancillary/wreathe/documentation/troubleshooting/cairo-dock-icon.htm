(see the Position tab of the Behavior section of the configuration; set Relative alignment to 0.500 to get it centered). If you have trouble dragging the selector bar to 0.500 exactly, try dragging it to the far left of its track to get it to zero and then using the scroll method of your input device [(trackpoint: hold right button and push trackpoint) (mouse: center scroll wheel) — scrolling moves by increments of 0.1 units — or by using the arrow keys on your keyboard (arrow keys move by increments of 0.05 units)] to adjust it to your desired value.</p> </main> </body> </html>
