The premise of the technology is to find ways to allow electronic equipment to communicate and establish connections to one another without depending on a central authority or centrally maintained resources such as an Internet service provider, commercially operated cables, or a name authority service. The technology allows electronic equipment to communicate and establish connections to one another without depending on a central authority or centrally maintained resources. There are some technical barriers to achieving the full potential of this technology, but various developments are leading towards its more widespread adoption.</p> <p>Research into ad-hoc computer network negotiation is ongoing, and implementing this widely, effectively, and practically is a difficult problem. In an ad-hoc computer network, individuals’ privately owned, portable equipment could perform all the necessary routing to establish a connection to any other node of the network.</p> <p>There are several pieces that must come together to effect such a technology.</p> <p>Consensus upon a standardized protocol for wirelessly establishing a decentralized network has not yet been fully established. Getting this consensus is largely a social and usage-dependent problem (the “network effect” creates something of a chicken-and-egg problem hindering the establishment of this). On the other hand, communication protocols to enable networking is a solved problem: the protocols which underlie Internet communication, UDP, TCP, and IP, are distributed already, which is what allows intranets and other independent, non-Internet-connected networks to communicate in an Internet-like fashion. The protocols are the same, but the independent networks are not connected to the specific instances of centralized trust systems that are a defining part of the Internet.</p> <p>Because fully distributed systems are inherently somewhat limited in their capabilities, due to the lack of a common trust system, this is not a technology that would entirely decentralize the Internet. Rather, it would provide a means for the system to continue operating in the event of losses of centralized service, and it would simplify replacing those few services which by nature must be centralized if an independent, separate network chose to implement them (a distributed centralization, in a sense, as it enables the centralized parts to be forked or replaced and to have their roles filled by equivalent but separate instances).</p> <p>One missing part of the technology is integrated relays for connectivity: if one piece of equipment can see another, and that one can in turn connect to the public Internet, there is no standardized protocol to enable the latter to route traffic on behalf of the former, and most common equipment does not provide the hardware necessary for such a facility. A protocol with a similar purpose has been implemented by ZigBee-brand communication hardware, which provides communication facilities for Internet of Things equipment, but it has a different purpose; even so it demonstrates the feasibility of the concept.</p> <p>A technology known as content-addressed storage systems enables the unambiguous identification of, and thereby discussion of, information, without the need to quote it in its entirety: whereas traditional citation formats (<em>e.g.</em> an author’s name and a title, or a Web URL) do not include enough information to verify that the cited document being viewed by a reader is the same as the document viewed by the author, by including a cryptographic hash, the content can be identified precisely. Brewster Kahle, quoting Peter Lyman, writes: “Now we can add something: ‘Content addressibility means that knowledge has a name.’” This is the system used by the Git distributed version control system, and it allows validation of the accuracy of a copy of a document or set of documents, and thereby validation of the authenticity of them as well through the use of cryptographic signatures.</p> <figure class="thumbnail-right thumbnail-top"> <a href="102-000.jpg"> <img src="102-000.jpg" alt="Photograph of Brewster Kahle"> </a> <figcaption>Brewster Kahle, founder of the nonprofit Internet Archive, who has advocated for the use of distributed networks to facilitate information access</figcaption> </figure> <p>The ability to locate and establish a connection to a specific network node given only its name and a connection to other nodes in the network, without centralization being needed, is demonstrated by distributed hash trackers (DHT). DHT is a content-addressed storage system using which, given a network connection, can return — given the cryptographic hash of desired information — the address of a computer containing the information corresponding to that hash, without any centralized authority. Similarly, an experimental system called Namecoin attempts to implement a decentralized alternative to the Internet’s Domain Name System using a similar technique.</p> <p>As with the Internet, verification of the identity of the connection thereby established can be accomplished using public-key cryptography, given an existing centralized public key infrastructure (PKI).</p> <figure class="thumbnail-right thumbnail-top"> <a href="102-001.jpg"> <img src="102-001.jpg" alt="Photograph of Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman"> </a> <figcaption>Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, authors of the 1976 paper “New directions in cryptography”, which was influential in the development of public-key cryptography in the private sector</figcaption> </figure> <p>Public key cryptography is a technology allowing messages to be sent securely to a person without first having a secure communication channel to exchange secret cryptographic keys. Simon Singh summarized the challenge posed by key sharing between geographically separated parties in traditional cryptography in The Code Book: “If two parties wanted to communicate securely, they had to rely on a third party to deliver the key, and this became the weakest link in the chain of security.” This challenge was overcome by developments in cryptography in the 1970s, allowing a public key infrastructure to be developed for the Internet. The PKI is one of the aspects of the Internet that cannot be effectively decentralized, due to the challenge of knowing whether a public key belongs to the network node it is purported to without any source of trusted information transfer from which to bootstrap trust of the given node.</p> <p>These other implementations show that many of the hard problems that obstruct and have historically prevented developing ad-hoc computer network negotiation have already been partially or fully solved by other technologies. This indicates that effective development and adoption of this technology is possible.</p> <p>The primary challenge remaining is not technical, but socioeconomic: an existing base of electronic equipment using a common protocol for distributed network routing is needed for any one piece of equipment with this capability to show substantial benefit to its owner, and individuals are unlikely to invest in the additional cost of the equipment necessary for this capability without knowing that they will be able to use it. This chicken-and-egg problem can be solved, however, in several means.</p> <p>The most likely solution is that one or more large equipment manufacturers will see the potential benefit of the technology and implement it in their products despite the additional cost. If it is provided and made available with new equipment when it is purchased, its benefits would be felt at least in part by consumers, driving other manufacturers to adopt it. Another possible solution for this issue is that governments, businesses, nonprofits, or other organizations will develop and produce equipment implementing this technology and use it for their work, and that this would provide the seed needed for its adoption.</p> <p>In any regard, this technology has huge potential benefits, because of the access to information it can provide: this facilitates, makes more effective, and democratizes access to emergency response and safety, business work in areas without established infrastructure, personal access to education and communication technologies, military operations, and the many other benefits afforded by access to the Internet.</p> </main> </body> </html>
