**Quick look equivalent** behavior (proposal): when using file manager or [[DCE interface]] [[project browser]] or [[indexing launcher tool|Home Screen]] (or KFind?), space should be the trigger hotkey for previewing documents Quick Look style. If a document or documents is/are selected, hotkey previews those. If no document or documents are selected, document under cursor is previewed & highlighted using a special color. While previewing documents, the arrow keys can be used to navigate between which document is being shown. Previews of multipage documents should be scrollable, & audio/video should be playable.
