==== Problem ====
Startup hangs when GDM would be expected to show up

This can (incorrectly) appear to be related to a number of messages from plymouth such as:
  * <code>
Illegal UART type: undefined
/dev/ttyS0 at 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a undefined</code>
  * <code>Failed to spawn plymouth-upstart-bridge main process - unable to execute - no such file or directory</code>
  * <code>Starting ClamAV daemon: clamd LibClamAV Warning: *******************************             *******************
LibClamAV Warning: ***  The virus database is older than 7 days!  ***
LibClamAV Warning: ***   Please update it as soon as possible.    ***
LibClamAV Warning: **************************************************
</code>
  * <code>init: Failed to spawn setvtrgb main process: unable to execute: No such file or directory</code>

Note that these are not necessarily exact copies of the messages as they appear in Wreathe (I got these from a few web searches based on keywords in the errors I got (from memory); to me they look identical to the errors I saw)

==== Solution ====

Run: 
  # aptitude reinstall gdm
and reboot
