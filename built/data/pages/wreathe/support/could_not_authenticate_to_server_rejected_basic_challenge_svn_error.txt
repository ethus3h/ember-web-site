===== "Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge" SVN error =====
==== Problem ====
Sometimes getting an error like this in svn:

<code>kyan@elegy:/media/MyBook/arcmaj3-client$ svn ci --username foo@bar.com --password baz 

Log message unchanged or not specified 
(a)bort, (c)ontinue, (e)dit: 
c 
Password for '(null)' GNOME keyring: 
svn: Commit failed (details follow): 
svn: MKACTIVITY of '/svn/!svn/act/uuuuuuuu-uuuu-uuuu-uuuu-uuuuuuuuuuid': authorisation failed: Could not authenticate to server: rejected Basic challenge (https://foo.example.com) </code>

==== Solution ====

The password being asked for here is NOT the SVN user password. Rather, it is asking for the GNOME keyring password (which is not changed when changing the Linux user password, so for me it's still elen-esar).
