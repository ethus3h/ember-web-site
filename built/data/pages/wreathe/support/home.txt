====== IRC channel: ======

[[irc://irc.futuramerlin.com:53126/#wreathe]]: Support channel for Wreathe. (If anyone's there.) Type "kyan" before your question to make sure I get dinged if I'm there.

===== Channel guidelines: =====
  * The channel is, ideally, logged (unless something goes wrong with irssi's logging)
  * I may publish the logs if I feel like it / get around to it
  * I may hang onto the logs indefinitely
  * Anyone is free to retain/publish their own logs if they care to do so; rock and roll archival
  * Be civil, etc.
  * My word is the final say when it comes to administering the channel
  * Don't try to take over a channel or anything; I'll just turn off the server and take it back

====== Asking questions: ======

To ask a question in the support website (here), go to [[publicquestions:home|public questions]] to do so.
