===== Summary =====

This article discusses the collision of journalistic freedom of speech and corporate economic interest that has arisen from ABC News's 2012 report on the use of lean finely textured beef (LFTB) as filler in other beef products.  Because the report only targeted beef producer Beef Products Inc., the company claims that the news report was written with the intention of damaging their company's image and reputation, while ABC News claim that their report was not produced with this objective in mind. The report claimed LFTB to not be meat. This point is disputed. According to the chemist See Arr Oh, the Code of Federal Regulations includes LFTB within its definition of meat. Judge Cheryle Gering, in her ruling on the case, considers a brief acknowledgement of contrasting views to not be sufficient to alleviate liability in the event that news reporting is defamatory. The news report questioned the safety of LFTB. Its safety was previously asserted by the Food and Drug Administration. According to the article, "legal experts" are concerned with the effects lawsuits of this type could have on journalism, possibly preventing journalists from producing reports of this nature due to the cost of defending against such a lawsuit.

===== Analysis =====

This article was quite well written. It does a good job of presenting the various concerns involved in the dispute, presenting both sides of the argument quite fairly and equitably. I would consider the article's mention of "legal experts" to be rather dubious, however. It provides two examples of this opinion, from Michael Dorf and from Lin Wood, but it fails to present opposing arguments regarding this matter. The article does not present arguments from third parties explaining and expressing clearly the corporate and economic interest in such lawsuits. While it provides this information in other ways, such examples of information from third parties I think is necessary to provide a clearer insight into the details of the situation.

One of the issues involved in this dispute is that of the public perception of LFTB. Since LFTB is produced from cattle, I think that it should be considered meat, and should be allowed in other meat products. However, I think that using it to add volume to those meat products while advertising and presenting them as being specific cuts or types of meat could be misleading; it is in consumers' interest to ensure that misleading advertising, if it is occurring in this situation, does not continue.
