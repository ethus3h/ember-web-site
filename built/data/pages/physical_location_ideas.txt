**Physical location ideas**: retail area, meditation area, soup kitchen, office (?), free shelter. Objective: provide a peaceful sanctuary where people can go when they need somewhere to go. Could have modular housing underground, extensible by addition of units? Meditation area & soup kitchen should be 24/7. Have work space for producing full-body suits? ←far-out idea, probably… Have multistory gardens, with mirrors to reflect sunlight in?
