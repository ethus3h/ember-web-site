<joepie91> dashcloud: what would you recommend for creating bin/cue on Linux? preferably something that can do error correction (a la ddrescue)
<dashcloud> joepie91: I've always used cdrdao - there may be a better software package, or set of switches for it, but this is the article I relied on: http://miketeo.net/wp/index.php/2008/05/10/creating-bincue-files-on-linux.html 
<dashcloud> the dosbox wiki recommends a much more involved command for making bin/cue files: http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Cuesheet I don't know if that is necessarily better than the other article though
<SketchCow> I use ISOdisk
