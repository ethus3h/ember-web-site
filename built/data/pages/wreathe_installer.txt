**Wreathe installer** ideas: Stage 1 — patched Ubiquity handles critical questions (remove prompts like language, keyboard layout, etc.), & installs base system (leave out lots of stuff). (No live system at this stage, since it’s not going to be a full installation on the first DVD (reboots when it’s finished.).) Stage 2 — Start OS from installation target. First run script executes graphical installer (maybe written using PyGTK?); prompts for 2nd DVD insertion. Copies files from DVD (presumably needs root privileges). Reboots; requests DVD removal. Stage 3 — Second-run script requests additional information: keyboard layout, serif vs. sans-serif, language, location, 12hour vs. 24hour, username & password, etc.. Eventually, linking to &/or signing up for an Ember account, & registering computer, will happen at this stage. Stage 3 does not use any external media. Patent warning should be displayed during stage 3, depending on location provided. When Wreathe is installed OEM, stage 3 is used as a first-run script on startup. Additional user account support should be added (maybe by Wreathe 7r3), but only the primary user account should be named & passworded during stage 3. A new user account should be created during installation (don’t just use “[[kyan]]”). Also, a lot of the config. Messiness that’s in the user’s home folder right now could be moved to systemwide. For now though, the ‘kyan’ account can just be renamed, repassworded, & moved during stage 3.
