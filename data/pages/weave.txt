**Weave** — the subject of this wiki, at the time of its creation — is a database designed to use relationships to organise information.

It is an organisational structure based on three classes of information using which all knowledge can be organised. Its structural philosophy uses [[nodes]], [[relationships]], and [[metadata]] to organise information. A [[node]] represents an individual item or concept. A [[relationship]] is a description of the connection between two [[nodes]]. A [[metadatum]] is an objective truth about a [[node]], such as the number of words in a book or the dimensions of a sculpture. (Illustrations of this are available at [[use cases]].)

Its homepage in English can be found at [[http://futuramerlin.com/r.php?c=w&a=1&locale=|http://futuramerlin.com/r.php?c=w&a=1&locale=]].

It uses the [[CDCE]] format for the storage of its data. It uses a MySQL database for storage. It is written in PHP.  This is a documentation wiki regarding it.
