<h2>Test runner operation</h2>
    <p>The test runner is one of the native tools included in a full EITE implementation. Its purpose is to load an instance of the EITE library, and run the unit tests included in the StageL build for the platform by running the "runTests" routine, displaying the outputs. It runs automatically, without the need for human intervention once it has been started. To do this, it needs to provide an output context that the runTests routine can use for displaying the test results.</p>
    <p>Here is a screenshot of the test runner for the Web implementation (found in web/tests.htm in the EITE installation root) while running the test suite:
