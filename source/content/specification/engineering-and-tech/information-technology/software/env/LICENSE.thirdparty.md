Some code used in and by this project is licensed under other licenses. The other licenses are available in the thirdparty-licenses/ folder. If there are any missing from there, please let me know so I can add them there. (The licenses for code that is included in tarballs that this project uses but are deleted by the buildsystem in the process of unpacking the tarballs are not included; see those tarballs for those licenses.)

All licenses should be free/libre/open-source licenses.

The list of licenses (taken from, and should be kept in sync with, the ebuild; AGPL-3+ is for the project itself, while the others are for its dependencies) is:
