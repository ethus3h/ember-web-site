<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This section documents the various real-world challenges involved in the project, and strategies for meeting those challenges.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial support</li>
        <li>Effective communication</li>
        <li>Team building</li>
        <li>Strategic planning</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project</li>
        <li>Ensure that organization's financial stability (presumably through sources such as an endowment and grants)</li>
        <li>Transfer control of the project's assets (Web presence, etc.) to that organization</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Tasks list</h2>

    <h3>Planning and strategy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The most important tasks are also the most difficult. Developing assets (specifications, software, etc.) is trivial compared to developing communication skills and establishing allies. There's a reason there are several usable computer programs developed for this project, but no other people working on it.</li>
            <li>My role in this project should be to coordinate and facilitate until a person or persons more capable is/are available, and/or until it is self-managed, and my presence or absence would have no appreciable effect on it.</li>
        </ul>

< People and communication
- Develop effective communication skills and strategies.
  - That means being able to express clearly, succinctly, and persuasively the following (at least): _what_ this project is, _why_ it is important and achievable, and _how_ to help with it.
  - This includes both in writing and in person. Improving my in-person communication skills is especially important.

## Finances, budget, and stability
- Finances: Develop a financial strategy and budget requirements. As a single, close to broke student without employment or a degree (yet), or a rich family giving me a small loan of a million dollars, I can barely support keeping the lights on for the Web site. (Hosting is somewhere in the US$5/month range. The domain name registration (`futuramerlin.com`) is good through the end of 2022, at which point it will need renewal, which is about US$10/year.) The most recent costs of technical infrastructure is US$106.20 for three years of Web hosting, plus US$83.76 for eight year ownership of domain name. A rough estimate of the cost for the semester of Web hosting is therefore US$17.70, and the cost for the semester of the domain name is US$5.24.
- While the project still has a bus factor of 1, my personal stability is critical for the project. Barring exceptional circumstances, I should be able to continue working on it through graduation thanks to the university and government's student financial aid, and my family's financial support.
- Significant volunteer involvement and/or external investment will be necessary for a full implementation of this project.

### Detailed budget estimates

All figures are rough estimates.

```

## Steps dependent on interpersonal connections
- Establish the physical community. This will require initial capital of *at least* tens of thousands of US dollars, as well as support for ongoing expenses.
- Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project
- Ensure that organization's financial stability (through sources such as an endowment and grants)
- Transfer control of the project's assets (Web presence, etc.) to that organization
