<p class="hatnote-emphasis-warning">Wreathe 7.3 is currently in development and is not yet supported. To install Wreathe, using <a href="/ancillary/wreathe">a current version</a> instead is recommended.</p>

    <p>It is probably possible to install Wreathe 7.3 on computers that do not meet the requirements to be supported. Note that systems that do not meet the recommended requirements are supported as long as they meet the basic requirements.</p>

<h2>Development Version Installation (not supported; for development and/or testing)</h2>
    <p>During development, Wreathe 7.3: Elegiac is distributed as a Portage overlay, and requires a working Gentoo GNU/Linux installation with layman installed. To install it, run as root:<br />
    <pre><code>cd /; wget https://github.com/ethus3h/wreathe-bootstrap/archive/v0.7.3_pre1.tar.gz; mv v0.7.3_pre1.tar.gz wreathe-bootstrap-v0.7.3_pre1.tar.gz; tar -xvzf wreathe-bootstrap-v0.7.3_pre1.tar.gz; echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/usr/local/portage/ ${PORTDIR_OVERLAY}"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf; emerge wreathe-base wreathe-overlays-redist</code></pre><br />
    Then, follow <a href="/ancillary/wreathe/documentation/experimental/updating.htm">the update instructions</a>.<!-- FIXME: provide instructions for rebuilding all binary packages --></p>
