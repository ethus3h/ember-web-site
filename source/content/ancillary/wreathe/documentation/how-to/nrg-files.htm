<p class="hatnote-emphasis-warning">Using UltraISO, or any other non-libre software, is no longer recommended.</p>

<p>Use the Windows program UltraISO, running using WINE. It has a free trial available that seemed to work the one time I used it. In case the website goes offline, the free trial installer can be downloaded from: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140108021242/http://dw.ezbsys.net/uiso9_pe.exe">https://web.archive.org/web/20140108021242/http://dw.ezbsys.net/uiso9_pe.exe</a></p>

<p>There are open source ways to work with these files, but I think UltraISO is probably the easiest solution.</p>

<p>Note that (from what I've been reading at least) the ISO format does not have the capacity to store multiple sessions (or multitrack sessions?). BIN/CUE seems to avoid this problem.</p>
