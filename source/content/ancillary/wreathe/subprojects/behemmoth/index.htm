<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A bullet-hell computer game with support for multiple players over the Web. It is a fork of Fabiano, and consequently is licensed under the AGPL3.</p>

    <p><span class="hatnote-emphasis-warning">The client is not yet confirmed to work without non-libre dependencies (it so far has only been successfully tested with Adobe Flash and the freshplayerplugin wrapper). Resolving this issue is a high priority. In addition, some of the "source code" for the project is actually binary blobs, due to the inclusion of precompiled dependencies and such; eliminating those is another high priority.</span></p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
        <h4>Client</h4>
            <h5>Syntax</h5>
                <figure class="center-figure app-syntax">
                    <code>behemmoth_client</code>
                </figure>
        <h4>Server</h4>
            <h5>Syntax</h5>
                <figure class="center-figure app-syntax">
                    <code>behemmoth_server</code>
                </figure>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>For Wreathe 7.3 and similar operating systems (e.g. Gentoo GNU/Linux), an ebuild (<code>games-roguelike/behemmoth</code>) is available in the <a href="/ancillary/wreathe">Wreathe</a> overlay.</p>
        <p>For other operating systems, use the following installation instructions.</p>

        <h4>Download</h4>
            <p>To download BeHeMMOth, run:</p>
            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/ethus3h/BeHeMMOth.git</code></pre>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>See the ebuild for details.</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Compilation</h4>
            <p><code>cd</code> into the source code directory, and run <code>make</code>.</p>
        <h4>Installation</h4>
            <p>Run <code>sudo make install</code>.</p>

    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>If the client gives a "Error loading language" error, it was probably unable to connect to the server. Make sure the server is accessible to the client. If the client just gives a black screen, the language file (e.g. <code>en.txt</code>) probably has an incorrect syntax (it must be a UTF-8 file in the form <code>[["key1", "value", "languageAbbreviation"], ["key2", "value", "languageAbbreviation"]]</code> with a byte order mark at the beginning; incorrect whitespace (e.g. newlines) or use of commas will probably cause problems). If the client says "Loading..." on a grey background on a black screen, make sure it has been added to the Adobe Flash trust list ("Global Settings" in the context menu). If when you try to enter a realm or the Nexus it takes a long time, just give it a minute; it may say "Socket-Server Security Error: Error #2048" and "Connection failed! Retrying...": this is <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/issue-tracker/view.php?id=528">a known issue</a> but doesn't seem to adversely affect use of the software.</p>
