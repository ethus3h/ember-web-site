<pre>EIDER AND OSPREY

Chorus:  Eider and Osprey take to the wind
         Rollin' blue ocean good to see you again
         Mountain top islands so strong and so bold
         Tell me the story your spruce and fir hold.

         To this camp on Hog Island
         I've come here to know
         Just how the cycles
           surrounding me flow
         I've come here to listen,
           to learn and to say,
         "There's only one earth â€”
           I'll speak for her today."

         Out on Wreck Island
         Where the Blue Herons nest
         We silently walked through
           an ancient forest
         Osprey and Black Backs soared
           through the air
         A sad thought it was that
           no others were there.

         On Eastern Egg Rock
           9 miles away
         Our little brothers are
           living today
         Many caring people
           in their special way
         Make sure the Puffins
           won't see their last day.</pre>
