What can be done: Education
</h3>
<p>
Another method for correcting this issue, using education, would be to  provide posters and create Public Service Announcements (PSAs) describing the harmful practices pertaining to factory farming and proposing methods for the consumers to remedy these issues, such as demonstrations, boycotts, and petitions. This method's advantage is that it would provide the people knowledge of how they could remedy this issue. Its disadvantage is that the people may not act on these proposals.
