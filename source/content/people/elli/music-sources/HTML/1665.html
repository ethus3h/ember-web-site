Workers have few rights
</h3>
<p>
The workers at the slaughterhouses have very little health care and Occupational Safety or Health Administration (OSHA) rights; they are sometimes illegal, often poorly-treated immigrant workers. The workers are not granted sufficient oversight or training, which can lead to their injury. The required OSHA inspections are very minimal: legislation permits them to be conducted by plant managers. They regularly maintain two sets of records: one for the parent corporation and one for the purpose of misleading OSHA[9].
