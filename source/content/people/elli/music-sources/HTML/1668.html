What can be done: Action
</h3>
<p>
A possible proposal using direct action would be to initiate a pro-livestock-rights group that would attempt to educate the public on the issues surrounding factory farming and act to remedy its problems. The advantage of this method is that it would have long-term effects such as the spread of knowledge in the consumers, reducing the number of consumers who would purchase food from restaurants that use factory-farmed food, reducing the corporations' profits. Its disadvantage is that it may not seem an appealing or “cool” activity to the restaurants' customers.
