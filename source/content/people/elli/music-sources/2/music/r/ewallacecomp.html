<h1>E. Wallace Comp.</h1>
Artist credited: E. Wallace (see comments)<br>

Year: ~2008<br>



Media: Audio CD.<br>



Instrumentation: See track pages.<br>



Description: (none)<br>



Comments: If I recall correctly, the label of this CD, which reads:<br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  E. Wallace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Comp.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; (some synthesized)</small><br>
<br>
(note that the spacing in the transcription might not be precise) was
added retroactively. Therefore, the artist credited and the release
title are both uncertain; it is possible that the release was
originally untitled.<br>
