    <li>Release <em>☯</em> (2009 (~4 October 2009? 4 October 2009 is the earliest file modification I can see, on the album artwork. Therefore, it may have been released ~4 October 2009. It is quite possible that it was however released later; 5 October 2009 is another likely date, as the second artwork panel (the one with the most complex track listings) was last modified 5 October 2009, indicating that an error in the listings may have been fixed then for the release. For simplicity's sake, I will use ~4 October 2009 in the listings here.)): <a href="../works/klgun/yy.htm">Klgun (2008 Remix)</a></li>
