<ul>
    <li>Release <em>Sylvan Fantasy | Re-Release</em> (2009 (~1 October 2009? 1 October 2009 is the earliest file modification I see. So, my conclusion is that it was probably released ~1 October 2009.)): <a href="../works/maxima/sylfanrr.htm">ùÜ∂</a></li>
    <li>Release <em>Full Moon</em> (2009 (~4 October 2009? 4 October 2009 is the file modification date on the artwork files.)): <a href="../works/maxima/fullmoon.htm">ùÜ∂</a></li>
    <li>Release <em><span style="font-style: italic;">Best Works:</span> Ô¥æ ‚àÇ»Éz«£ Ô¥ø <span style="font-style: italic;">through</span> <span style="font-family:anoeyfuturamerlincommedium,AnoeyFuturamerlincom;">,itfaen-at√©l-eselit.</span> | Part 1</em> (2009 (Probable dates: 10 December 2009, 11 December 2009, (less likely) 19 December 2009, (less likely) 30 December 2009. All artwork files were modified 10 December 2009, with the exceptions of the files "cdcover copy.key" and "Backup of cdcover copy.key" (11 December 2009), and the files in the folder "v2" (19 December 2009). Possibly the artwork was revised after release on either 11 December 2009 or 19 December 2009. The audio files were last modified 19 December 2009, with the exceptions of tracks 2, 3, 4, and 5, which were last modified 30 December 2010; that is probably due to retagging them or some such thing. Because the most recently edited artwork files for Part 2 were modified 11 December 2009, I conclude that this album was probably released 10 or 11 December 2009.)): <a href="../works/maxima/bestworksitfaenpt1.htm">ùÜ∂</a></li>
