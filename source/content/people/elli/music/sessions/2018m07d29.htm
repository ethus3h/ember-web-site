Three of the files created during the course of this session ('Piece 3 June 2010 C. E 2018 July 507p.xml' / 'Piece 3 June 2010 C. E 2018 July 507p.mscz' / 'Piece 3 June 2010 C. E 2018 July 29 1058p.pdf') are merely file format conversions of an older revision of this work, rather than a new revision.</dd>
