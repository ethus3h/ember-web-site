note,in Personal git repository: 'NEW exported 2018aug04.pdf' / 'Screenshot_2018.08.04_16.52.22.png' / 'New in Dorico 2018 August 3 730p.pdf'. 'NEW exported 2018aug04.pdf' is the "NEW.mid" file (modification date 2010-June-06) opened in MuseScore and saved as PDF, and 'Screenshot_2018.08.04_16.52.22.png' is the "NEW" file (modification date 2006-June-03) opened in Sibelius and screenshotted: merely file format conversions of an older revision of this work, rather than a new revision. I think that the date of 'New in Dorico 2018 August 3 730p.pdf' is probably wrong (chat logs indicate it was from 2018m08d04).
