    <dt>Note</dt><dd>in Personal git repository: 'NEW exported as FLAC using MuseScore 2018aug06.flac'. This file is the "NEW.mid" file (modification date 2010-June-06) opened in MuseScore and saved as FLAC: merely a file format conversion and normalization of an older revision of this work, rather than a new revision. The reason for the two FLAC files and one AIFF file made today, and the Sibelius → PDF score, is because I was wondering what was weird about the way bar 13 sounded: the reason is the "NEW.mid" seems to be missing the third 16th note of bar 13, even though it is in the Sibelius score. I presume this is an error, and that the note is indeed intended to be there, as it is in the score, although if I were composing this piece with more focus on the sound of it than the notation, it is possible that the absent note was desired due to overlooking the glitch and liking the sound of it with the missing note. Either is plausible, but I suppose I will assume the former to be correct for the time being.</dd>
