note,The album artwork includes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141206141624/http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs7/i/2005/258/3/4/Paper_texture_v1_by_bashcorpo.jpg">this image</a>, by the DeviantArt user <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141206141624/http://bashcorpo.deviantart.com/">bashcorpo</a> (Dan Bashie Larsen). Note 2020m4d21: The taito kanji in the release title is a different variant than the one used on the taito EP. This one is closer to the form encoded in Unicode. I'm not sure if they're all supposed to be unified with the encoded one. For purposes of these releases, I think the variant used is relevant, so am leaving it PUA-mapped unless or until there are IVSes or encodings of them, I suppose.
