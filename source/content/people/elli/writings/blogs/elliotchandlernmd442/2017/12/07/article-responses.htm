<h2>Response to "<a href="https://www.worryfreelabs.com/the-future-of-ui-ux-with-an-emphasis-on-the-x/">The Future of UI / UX Design</a>"</h2>
<p><em>Article by David Issa: 18 April 2017, in </em>Worry Free Labs</p>
<p>In the introduction to this article, the author writes that "the experience consumers have with your company <em>is the product</em>" (emphasis in original). This statement was quite striking to me. It makes me wonder whether because of this, non-profit organizations may supplant for-profit companies, especially Web companies, as Wikipedia (from the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation) has done to some extent for encyclopedias. Nonprofits often have a much better public image than for-profit companies, and their Web sites generally have a much nicer user experience due to the elimination of intrusive third-party advertizing, being replaced by grants and donation funding. While it may be a while yet before non-profit organizations completely supplant for-profit Web companies, I definitely think it is something worth pursuing. In the main body of the article, the author discusses some potentially disruptive innovations that will affect the UI and UX fields. One of these is prefaced by the heading "The Re-Emergence of Craftsmen &amp; Industrial Designers". Did they ever <em>leave</em>? It seems they have been critical in the success of, for instance, Apple Computer's products.</p>

<p>This article seems to be a variation of the previous one by Issa, that adds additional detailed discussion regarding the disruptive innovations. My single favorite phrase in this is "personalized manufacturing". That is just so exciting! I often know exactly what I want, but can't find a company to sell it to me for an affordable price, because no one else wants it. If that phrase becomes a trend, and then blossoms into a mainstream, affordable production model... I will be overjoyed.</p>

<p><em>Article by Chase Buckley: 27 April 2016, in </em>UX Magazine</p>
<p>The first thing in this article that sticks out to me is "micro-mini interactions". <em>Really?</em> Can't pretty much any user interaction be broken down into smaller elements of interaction? The idea that this is a new element of user interaction seems fairly straneg to me. I can definitely being something <em>designers</em> start focusing on more, though. The weather apps mockup shown in the article is certainly pretty, but all it shows is the location, date, and temperature. I'd expect users would prefer an app that can actually be useful, such as by giving a full forecast and thus <em>making use of all the space available to it</em>, over something visually attractive but impractical. Sacrificing usefulness in the interest of aesthetics always <em>does</em> seem like a silly choice to me. In terms of age-specific design, do they have evidence showing that older people dislike saturated colors? They can grate on me, and I'm not <em>that</em> old yet, I don't think. (Also, I almost invariably want large, high-contrast text even though I have basically perfect eyesight, because the nightmarish alternatives that the designers of some products seem to love are painful to read.)</p>

<p><em>Article by Claire Rowland: May 2015, in </em>Designing Connected Products</p>
<p>I definitely could use a medication reminder pill-cap. In other news: "In the Warren Ellis story “The Lich House” a woman is unable to shoot an intruder in her home: her gun cannot contact the Internet for the authentication that would allow her to fire it." Heh, I've thought of use-time authentication for weapons before, I think it's a great solution to the gun control issues. But why would you require it to connect to the Internet to work? As in, didn't <em>anyone</em> pause to say "uhhh, might anyone need their gun when the Internet is down"? This seems like a serious case of "d'ohhhhhhhh" to me. (Solution: a tamper-protected self-contained module that uses biometric data to check authentication, and if the infrastructure is available nearby, can figure out if the person is in an area where they have the right to shoot, so they aren't able to shoot on government buildings, school campuses, etc.) Regarding the issue of Internet latency and reliability, in general the principle applied here in this article to IoT devices ("Latency on the Internet is out of your control (and reliability is not 100%)") applies to <em>all</em> software products, and the service will be orders of magnitude better if it can sorta-kinda work without Internet access.</p>
