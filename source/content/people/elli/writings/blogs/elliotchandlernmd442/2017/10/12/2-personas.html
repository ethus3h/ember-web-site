<h1>Snow plowing app personas</h1>

<h2>Customer Persona #1</h2>

<p>Jody is a 46-year-old on-call power company electrician, living in upstate New York, in a rural area near a town with 15,000 residents. They get about 45 inches of snow each winter, in six to ten storms in a typical year. Because Jody needs to go to job sites when there are power outages — typically during storms — they often have to leave their driveway when it is snowing. Because of this, having an on-demand plow service app is critical to their business, so they can get out of their driveway. Jody makes about $30,000 per year, and has a 13 year old Scion xB SUV as their vehicle. Because the vehicle isn't very good in the snow, and is unable to accommodate a plow, Jody can't plow their own driveway.</p>
<p>Jody has a smart phone, so they can use a Web interface for making snow plowing requests. Jody needs an app that is simple and easy to read, because they have a hard time using software that is low-contrast, small, or otherwise hard to see, due to failing eyesight.</p>
<p>For Jody, getting their drive way plowed quickly when they need to go to work is important. They are willing to pay more for plowing than the base rate, so they would find it useful to be able to offer a bounty for expedited service in the plow app. Jody has a few close friends, and goes to community events often, but is not influential in the community. Their personality is usually quiet but strong and not shy. Jody is not an early adopter of new technologies, usually waiting until they have become quite mainstream to investigate them. Jody values efficiency, precision, and focus in lifestyle.</p>
<p>Jody is a profitable regular customer of the snow plowing app. Jody is willing to use commercial branded products if the products serve their needs, and doesn't attempt to avoid them, but does not value brand loyalty or fashion over practicality. Jody’s perception of the plowing brand is as a simple, functional tool to enable them to get to work. They do not have any emotional attachment to the brand. Jody's perception of the value of the app is determined by how quickly they are able to get their drive way plowed at short notice when they need to go to work. Being told by their supervisor that they are needed to deal with damage to the municipal electrical infrastructure is their trigger to engage with the app.</p>
<p>Jody’s attitude toward the technology medium (smart phone app) is somewhat comfortable with installing apps, but without a lot of experience with a wide range of apps. Jody finds traditional desktop computer apps more comfortable, having extensive familiarity and expertise with Microsoft Office 2000, which they used in their previous job as a self-employed electrician for tracking customers.</p>
<p>Jody enjoys going to church suppers and other events in the community, and likes hiking in the mountains nearby. They are physically active and fit, and can easily shovel their driveway when they do not have to leave quickly. Because of this, Jody’s desire for efficiency means they do not want to hire a plow person to plow when they do not need to leave, since it would save money for them to shovel it themselves. Because it takes a while to shovel, being a large driveway, Jody needs to have plow service to be able to leave on demand for their work. They do not receive many visitors at their home, about two per month, and any visitors are scheduled in advance, so Jody does not need to keep the driveway plowed regularly in anticipation of unannounced visitors.</p>

<h2>Customer Persona #2</h2>

<p>Gary is a new graduate from university, with a degree in mathematics. Gary is 24 years old, working as a data analyst for a cement processing company in North Dakota. Gary lives at the edge of a city with 40,000 residents. The city gets roughly four snow storms each winter, generally giving large amounts of snow, between 18 and 24 inches in a typical storm. Gary has a 9 to 5 job schedule, and needs to be able to leave and return from their drive way regularly. Gary’s interest in the plow service is to get a set-it-and-forget-it service for plowing, where they can specify that when there are more than three inches of snow, they want their drive way plowed. Gary makes about $45,000 per year, and their vehicle is a three year old Hyundai Santa Fe. The vehicle is quite good at driving in snow, but Gary does not want to have a plow on it, because a plow would add wear and tear and would require extra thought and focus, and their job needs a lot of energy, so Gary does not want to think about plowing themselves. However, because it is good in the snow, Gary does not want the drive way plowed at all when there are only three or fewer inches of snow, because they can just drive out on it.</p>
<p>Gary has a smart phone that they were given by a family member, but does not really use it much and is not comfortable using it. Gary is right-handed, but has right hand partially paralyzed from an accident while bicycling, so finds touch-driven interfaces difficult to use, and wants large tap targets in them. Gary is good at typing, using a left-hand Dvorak keyboard.</p>
<p>Gary is a loner, and does not really participate in the community, usually just staying home and watching sports on television after they get home from work. They are quite an energetic personality, but are too tired after work to do much. Gary is not interested in most computing technology, and avoids it when possible, but is skilled at doing statistical analysis using the R language in a command-line UNIX-like computing environment. Gary’s focus in life is to enjoy their work and learn more about mathematics.</p>
<p>Gary is an average customer of the snow plowing app, not being particularly profitable but not being unprofitable either. Gary avoids commercial branded products if possible, and only uses them when they are the most practical choice. They use smart phone and plowing app because of a family member who really wants Gary to get into this sort of thing. Gary is hostile to branding in general, but has no particular animosity towards the plowing app, as it has served them well. Gary’s perception of the value of the app is determined by how little they have to think about it: they are happiest when they can just configure regular plowing and set up the criteria for when they want to get plowing, and then leave it be and have their drive way plowed for them without having to put more thought into it.</p>
<p>Gary is not comfortable at all with smart phones, or electronics in general, outside of R and command-line UNIX.</p>
<p>Gary likes weight lifting on weekends, and is moderately fit. While they could shovel their driveway, for the same reason that they do not want to try to plow it themselves they do not want to: it would take away from their energy for work during the week.</p>

<h2>Customer Persona #3</h2>

<p>Karan is a sixty-six year old retired pro tennis player.

Karan lives in Strasburg, in northern Virginia, with a population of about 7,000, and which gets a few storms each year with a small amount of snow. Karen’s interest in the plow service is to get a simple set-it-and-forget-it service for plowing, where they can request plowing for snow. Unlike Gary, Karan doesn’t want to think about the amount of snow, or anything like that. Karan’s vehicle is a one year old Tesla Model S. The vehicle is not very good at driving in snow.
