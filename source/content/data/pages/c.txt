**c** is the function that handles conversion from [[CDCE]] to HTML.

It takes one argument — a [[CDCE]]-formatted string — , [[$content]].

So the syntax of c is: 

   c($content)

It will not echo the resulting parsed text; rather it will return it. It will use the [[database]] to find the HTML content for the [[CDCE]]. It will probably need additional logic beyond simple search-and-replace for more complicated things like formatting date ranges or links etc. See the page on [[CDCE]] for more information about how this works.

The comment in the code describing what this function does is:

		#Parse a supplied CDCE string and return it as HTML
