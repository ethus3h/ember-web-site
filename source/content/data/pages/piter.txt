**Питер** (Latin transliteration: piter) is a designation for extra-stable Wreathe systems (currently [[Wreathe 5: Rain]]). The name Питер was chosen because it is the Cyrillic transcription of the name Peter (meaning //rock//), and as a reference to the 1987 USSR made-for-TV movie //Питер Пен// (admittedly it has nothing to do with the movie other than being the inspiration for the name, but whatever).
