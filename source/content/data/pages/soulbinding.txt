**Soulbinding** is the state of completely knowing one's spirit-self, and linking one's mind and manifestations. When one knows one's spirit-self fully, one becomes able to shape and define one's mind, Aetheric manifestation, and Earthly manifestation. This state can only be achieved by one with a pure spirit-self. One becomes one's true master when in a soulbound state.
