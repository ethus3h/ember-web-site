====== Slight suck ======

  * Perfect World International — the flying is lame, since one can't go up or down, and can't fly for very long. Given that my primary interest in the game was the flying, naaaaah.

====== Major suck ======

  * La Tale — Disconnects from server
  * ArcheAge — Clicking play does nothing
  * Flyff — Closes and redirects to sketchy GameGuard website with error 114 when trying to open it.
