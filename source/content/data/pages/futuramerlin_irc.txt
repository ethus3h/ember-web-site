**Futuramerlin IRC** is an IRC server hosting Futuramerlin-related channels. It is at irc://irc.futuramerlin.com:53126/ (at least after the DNS propagates or whatever it's called; the server now is at irc://130.111.242.99:53126/ ). The port number was chosen as sort-of leet for "FMIRC" (=**F**utura**m**erlin **IRC**). The server was created 14 January 2014.

It uses ircd-irc2.

As of 14 January 2014, the MOTD (message of the day) is:

<code>
                                  futuramerlin
 
       topics: support for wreathe, ember, or other futuramerlin projects
                            look for kyan for support

                                 to join, type:
                              /join #futuramerlin
                               and start talkin'.

                    this server should be logged/archived.
</code>

I changed it a bit from what I first had it as (IIRC all I changed was "server is logged" → "server should be logged" (and recentered the line) but I'm not totally sure; I'd have to check the logs from irssi/something, if I have them. Oh well, I should have archived the older version. Not a massive loss to history though I guess.
