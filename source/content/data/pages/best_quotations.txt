  * "Yo mamma's so fat that MOV EAX, YOMOMMA sets the carry flag" —perspichaos ( http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1vm6rg/is_apple_ever_going_to_drop_osx_and_go_to_os_11/ )
    * Explanation: <code>ok, its easy, they are instructions, assembly programming instructions.

"MOV", means to copy a number in a register(the workspace of a cpu, where the cpu is actually working directly on, the ram is the in and out work flow trays and the HDD is the filing cabinet) to another register or a place in a ram.

"EAX" means a register, a location.

as far as i know, writing MOV must be follow by specifying 2 locations.

like MOV A,B

so as far as i know, MOV EAX is not legal.

but the other thing about MOV is that the locations are usually of the same size, 32 bit cpus only have 32 bit registers, so MOV will never set of the CARRY FLAG.

now what is the carry flag?

consider the following operation

123 + 188 = ?

first you add the ones, 8 + 3 = 11,

that would mean the operation for the digits in the ones position add up to 1 one and 1 ten, therefore, you carry 1 ten into the tens position,

so for the tens, you do this

2 + 8 + 1(carried over) = 11

which is 1 tens, and 1 hundreds, so you carry 1 over into the hundreds position, so on and so forth.

there is also an assembly instruction called ADD which as you can easily surmise, adds 2 numbers in a register and puts the result in one of the registers.

now what are registers?

as mentioned registers are containers to hold information for the cpu to work on.

registers have size limits. imagine 2 containers can can only contain 2 digits each,

container A holds "90"

container B holds "10"

ADD A,B means to take the digit in B and add it to the digit in A, and place the result in register A

so 90 + 10 = 100.

but the container can only hold 2 digits. so the container A will be set by the CPU to "00" and the carry flag is set. and the programmer will usually have further calculations that rely on the result of this calculation and thus rely on the CARRY FLAG.

boiled down to it. a CARRY FLAG means the digit is too huge to contain inside 1 register, the excess of that digit are here, come do something about it!

as i mentioned earlier, MOV cannot set the CARRY FLAG, as things inside 1 register, has to fit inside another register, since for the cpu to work, all registers has to be of the same size.

so YO MOMMA SO FAT, that when you MOV her, the CPU sets the CARRY FLAG, because she is infinitely overflowing.....

anyhow you might wonder why is the CARRY FLAG a flag, and not a register that contains another number? it boils down to the fact that CARRY FLAGs will never hold more that the value "1".

why?

You see, computers deal with data by changing them into numbers, numbers are dealt with by changing them into base 2.

What is a base?

base X means that each position of the number has X possible states, and the next position is a multiple of the first position.

for instance, a base 10 notation number has 10 possible state in each position. i.e 0 to 9.

So to understand the number 506, which is it self a base 10 notation,

we do this

->(6 X 100) + (0 X 101) + (5 X 102)

=(6 X 1) + (0 X 10) + (5 X 100)

=6 + 0 + 500

=506

now you can make base anything, base 9000 if you are so inclined, but right down to it, computers are binary, meaning base 2.

meaning, each digit can only be 0 or 1.

why we do this, its because of the mechanical and electrical nature of the smallest elements of a computer microchip. so a relatively high voltage is a 1, and a relatively low voltage is a 0.

to interpret base 2 in base 10, we can do the following calculation.

base 2 -> 1010 means (0 X 20) + (1 X 21) + (0 X 22) + (1 X 23)

=(0 X 1) + (1 X 2) + (0 X 4) + (1 X 8)

=0 + 2 + 0 + 8

=11 in our normal numbering system. tada!

so since computers only work in BASE 2, the CARRY FLAG will never be more than the value "1". you just have to contextually calculate it among other values from the correct position.
