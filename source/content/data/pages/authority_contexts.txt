These do not indicate that information is guaranteed correct within the given authority context, but only that that is the intended authority of the material.

  * Objective consensus: Like Wikipedia. Neutral point of view. Doesn't necessarily represent all points of view equally because of lack of consensus about them.
  * Objective egalitarian: Neutral point of view, and tries to accept all viewpoints as equally legitimate.
  * Subjective consensus: No neutral point of view, but established by general consensus.
  * Objective single/subset source: Neutral point of view, as established by a single source or a subset of available sources.
  * Objective individual/organization source: Neutral point of view, as believed by an individual or organization.
  * Subjective single/subset source: Opinion (no neutral point of view), as established by a single source or a subset of available sources.
  * Subjective individual/organization source: Opinion (no neutral point of view), as believed by an individual or organization.

And the in-universe counterparts of the above:
  * In-universe consensus
