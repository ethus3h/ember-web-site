====== Rules/guidelines ======

While this wiki isn't particularly strict regarding scope, things should be kept organized. Factual things should go in [[:ref:start|Reference info.]]. Fiction writing should go in [[:literature:fiction:start|Fiction]]. Poetry should go in [[:literature:poetry:start|Poetry]]. I want to have a way to provide a place for blogs, tooâ€¦ maybe [[:blogs:start|Blogs]]. There could be some overlap between these.
