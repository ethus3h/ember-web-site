=====Mounting a remote computer as a folder=====


Mounting (attaching) a remote computer as a folder using curlftpfs or sshfs (the mount point must exist and be owned by the user running these commands; running as root is not recommended):

Using curlftpfs (probably faster but less secure) (in the example, the username on the remote computer is username, its password is password, the remote computer is at ip.add.re.ss (domain name works here too), the folder ~/directory is being mounted (the directory specified there is relative to the user's home directory; using /../.. or something like that might get you to the actual root directory) and it is being mounted at the directory /mountpoint):

  curlftpfs -o umask=0777,uid=1000,gid=1000,allow_other ftp://username:password@ip.add.re.ss/directory /mountpoint

Using sshfs:

  sshfs username@ip.add.re.ss:/ /path/to/mount/point/


===== My other tries =====

I was trying to make it so that I can attach my Debian computer at a mountpoint on Wreathe, over the network. I tried (not necessarily in this order):
  * sshfs: slow; eats RAM
  * curlftpfs: good but not quite as fast as I'd like. Doesn't support symlink creation.
  * WebDAV/davfs: transfers are fast but listing a directory locks up Dolphin
  * SMB: Couldn't figure out how to set it up
  * NFS: Couldn't figure out how to set it up; I think there's a version mismatch between Debian (version 4) and Wreathe (version 3)

AFP is also a possibility, but I haven't tried it.
