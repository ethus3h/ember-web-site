====== How to open a NRG disk image file, or convert a NRG disk image to another format (such as BIN/CUE or ISO) ======

Use the Windows program [[http://www.ezbsystems.com/ultraiso/|UltraISO]], running using WINE. It has a free trial available that seemed to work the one time I used it. In case the website goes offline, the free trial installer can be downloaded from: https://web.archive.org/web/20140108021242/http://dw.ezbsys.net/uiso9_pe.exe

There are open source ways to work with these files, but I think UltraISO is probably the easiest solution.

Note that (from what I've been reading at least) the ISO format does not have the capacity to store multiple sessions (or multitrack sessions?). BIN/CUE seems to avoid this problem.
