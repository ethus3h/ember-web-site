====Problem====

Wreathe freezes while booting at "ACPI CORE REVISION" message

====Solution====

Try one or all of the following possible solutions, which may or may not work:

  * Unplug the computer; if it has a main power battery (for example a laptop battery or a UPS), disconnect it. Wait a bit, then plug everything back in and restart again.
  * More likely solution: Select Wreathe in the boot menu. Press e to edit the boot commands. Add <code>acpi=off</code> to the end of the line beginning with <code>linux</code>, something like this: <code>linux	/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.35-32-generic-pae root=UUID=78f2b919-b283-4d6b-a062-0886549c3b92 ro nosplash  quiet splash acpi=off</code>. Press Control+X to boot. When you are given a login prompt, shut down the computer. Start the computer again.
  * Also possible: Disable USB support in the BIOS options.
