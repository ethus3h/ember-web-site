====== Futuramerlin New Page =======

**Futuramerlin New Page** (**FMNP**) is a document metamarkup format (using the syntax @x@ to supplement HTML syntax — where x is an identifying code)

Those are called [[@-codes]].

There are two generations of this format.

===== First-generation FMNP =====

[[First-generation FMNP]] was used by (IIRC) render-page.php and pageview.php (and maybe v.php??).

===== Second-generation FMNP =====

[[Second-generation FMNP]] is used by r.php and (IIRC) v.php.

===== Third-generation FMNP =====

[[Third-generation FMNP]] is not a traditional FMNP format. Each page (having the file extension .s#p3) is a [[Futuramerlin Active Scripting Library]] PHP script, using [[FASL]]'s Document_F class to generate and display the page. Format first created 11 September 2013.
