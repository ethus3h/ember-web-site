The **Futuramerlin.com Wiki**.

Judging from the first revision of the start page, "Welcome to the Futuramerlin.com Wiki, reopened 27.11.2010.", this is a reincarnation of an earlier [[Futuramerlin.com Wiki]].

A wiki created 27 November 2010. Removed from the website. Later (14 or 15 January 2014, if the creator recalls correctly) restored from a backup. Fixed (had a .htaccess problem with a directive <code>AddType x-mapp-php5 .php</code> needed for a previous webhost) / made available on 15 January 2014.

This is not the main wiki currently used by Futuramerlin. That is the Futuramerlin [[Documentation (wiki)|Documentation]] wiki.

On 15 January 2014, the wiki was made read-only (except for the admin) to preserve it in its historic state.
