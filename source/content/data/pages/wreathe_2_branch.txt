**Wreathe 2*** was the second branch of [[Wreathe]]. It was part of the [[autumnfairy]] release group. It seems likely that it was going to be named "Mist"; I seem to recall thinking of it by that name at the time, and the misty default artwork seems to reinforce that hypothesis. (The default artwork in Wreathe releases corresponds to the release name.)
