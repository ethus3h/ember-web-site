===== Assert =====
  assert(aVariable = "What Its Value Should Be");

<code>

}
catch(ArrayIndexoutOfBoundsException e){
    //do other things
}</code>

(exact copy attempt from the presentation the TA gave in class today)
^ Situation      ^ What to use       ^ 
| Checking instance variables at start or end of method | assert |
| Checking parameters to protected and private methods | assert |
| Checking parameters to public methods | IllegalArgumentException |
| Handling exceptions  | Try-catch |
===== Eating exceptions =====
Using try… catch to sweep an error under the rug.
