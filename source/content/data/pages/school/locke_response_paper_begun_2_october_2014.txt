===== Part 1: The Institution =====

==== Rationale ====

In my view, human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords those partaking of its benefits, I believe there is a need for a unified institution to be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures to provide some semblance of a filling of this void. While humans, as any other life, have the liberty of doing as they choose, and, in one way of looking at things, have no obligation to any particular social contract or structure, — (in other words — technically, everyone has the choice to do what they want, inasmuch as they can send the electrical signals to their nerves they choose to when they choose to, assuming they have such physical capacity) — while such "liberty" is indeed held by humans, they have come to expect and rely upon such social constructs for their safety and mutual benefit. For such reasons I feel it ideal to pursue the measure of establishing a single institution as I mentioned above. Those who choose not to partake of the protections I propose that such an organization would provide would, of course, open themselves up to forceful control by any who see fit: they would end up finding themselves in Hobbes' "state of nature", "all at war with all", albeit a state of nature that could perhaps be considered adulterated by the existence of power structures outside of their control. Locke writes that "The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth" ... "to have only the law of nature for his rule" (Locke 15). There presently exist many types of authority in the world, for example: the law of war, the principles established by the United Nations and similar organizations, the laws established by states' governments and their constituents (in the United States this would encompass the powers vested in the national, state, county, and township authorities, for example), and the bounds enforced within a family. What I propose in this essay does not neatly fall into any of those categories. It would not attempt to interfere with those authorities, allowing it to coexist with them — thus its purpose being mainly the protection of and provision for those people who choose to become, so to speak, the shareholders and benefactors of its contract. It would ideally provide some recourse for those who would desire asylum from those other power structures, by holding land, under its exclusive control, that it could share in various ways such as:
  * through issuance of private parcels within which the owners could dictate their terms, and
  * the construction of tenements made available without charge to those participating in the organization I propose,

within all of which, parcels and tenements, the sole binding policy (in other words, the protections and/or restraints imposed through the organization's policy, doctrine, and practice) would be those of the organization (beyond any that may be held by private landholders). (There could also be, and in all probability would be, unallocated land over which no control is held or claimed.) Through allocation of such private parcels, large governments could theoretically be provided land technically held by this organization I propose, them being given authority over the land to dispense of as they choose — although such an arrangement would perhaps be unnecessary, as land with existing power structures would presumably be already managed in fair order. Locke writes that a king's privilege "may be questioned, opposed, and resisted" if he uses "unjust force" (Locke 116). In all, the basic premise of what I propose is yet another layer of order provided on an opt-in basis within the context of a world which is, fundamentally, in what I would consider a state of nature with power structures founded within it. (This brings to mind one of my arguments against some philosophical ideals of "anarchy": the true absence of any social order imposed on the world would by definition allow the imposition of order by those within it, thus creating something of a paradox.) And yet, Locke writes that if "the electors or ways of election are altered  without the consent and contrary to the common interest of the people" then "those chosen are not the legislative appointed by the people" (Locke 121). This is used as a justification for revolution, for example in Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, as mentioned in Professor Glover's lecture of Tuesday.

===== Part 2: The Spirit =====

There is a somewhat poorly defined (in that it is commonly understood without reference to quantifiable metrics) concept I find worthy of consideration here: that of "evil". It is a label commonly applied to things that fall outside of the bounds of the dominant moral dicta of the group or authority applying the label. Nevertheless, evil can be accurately assessed and described through its relation to specific fundamental premises relevant to the maintenance of an ordered society. Using such a basis for its description, evil is any action which disrupts the significant objectives and wellbeing of the society, culture, or individual affected by the actions beyond what is reasonable, and is justifiable by practicalities, such as survival and convenience. This concept is connected to the traditional Christian philosophy of everyone being a sinner (for my purposes, "sinner" referring to a person who has committed evil actions), but, given such a definition of "sinner", I think that such a generalization would necessarily not include the "reasonable and justifiable" limitation, since human life almost invariably disrupts in some way the life around it (for example, in all probability most commonly in the northeastern United States by stepping on insect life and vegetation, which is difficult to avoid as a consequence of their ubiquity; or by eating food, a process which frequently involves the killing of edible plants and/or animals or the denial of a seed's and/or egg's germination), thus rendering nearly every human a sinner, and also a committer of evil acts assuming the conditional above is not taken into account. For this reason I think that a sinner should be considered as anyone who acts in a manner to disrupt the significant objectives and wellbeing of a society, culture, or individual, regardless of whether such disruption is potentially justifiable. (It also would presumably be evil to harbor fantasies of evil acts, since such fantasy would likely lead to some level of mental justification of them, subconsciously increasing the likelihood of the fantasizer committing such acts; although since it is presumably unreasonable to expect perfection in the area of avoiding such fantasy it is likely to fall under the conditional I mentioned above, except perhaps in extreme cases. This concept is quite contentious, however, given the widespread culture of respect (in Western society, at any rate) towards the absolute freedom of the mind. Personally, I have reservations about restrictions on thought, especially in terms of the possibility of legislating them; however I do think that speech and other expression should be restricted in some cases.)
