===== Summary =====
This article discusses a recent proposed increase to the minimum wage in San Diego. Lawmakers have proposed this change, but it has been opposed by local businesses and the Chamber of Commerce. The argument in favor of this increase is backed up by the statistics of three hundred thousand households in the county being financially unable to meet basic needs, but only 180,000 workers are making within a dollar an hour of the minimum wage. The article mentions that businesses are not entirely opposed to an increase in the minimum wage, but there is dissent regarding the amount and the rapidity of implementation of such a change.

===== Analysis =====
While the article discusses some of the issues involved and presents an effective argument for the raising of the minimum wage, it neglects to address some of the important issues such a change would present. For example, while suggesting that the minimum wage increase could be tied to a cost-of-living estimate, it hardly mentions the effects a minimum wage increase could have on the cost of living. If the economic equilibrium is disturbed too rapidly, it would be very conceivable for the cost of living to increase correspondingly to the changes in the minimum wage, which would in turn increase yet again to compensate for the increased cost of living. This sort of "vicious cycle" effect is not really discussed as a possible outcome by the article. While such a serious effect would be unlikely, a similar effect on a lesser scale could seriously disrupt the local economy. In neglecting to address these issues, I must conclude that the article shows a clear bias in its selection of subjects in the debate to discuss, and thus its conclusions — though not necessarily its data — should be taken with a grain of salt.
