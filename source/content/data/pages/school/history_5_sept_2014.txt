History for MAT126, 5 September 2014.
Elliot Wallace.

In high school, I took mathematics courses up through calculus. I didn't do very well at calculus, and have since forgotten most of what I learned in it.

I took precalculus both in high school and last year here at the university, and enjoyed it both times.

I struggle with arithmetic and polynomial factoring. I enjoy algebra, and am moderately good at it.
