Article: McMaken, Ryan. "Why we're paying more for corn". 24 February 2012. //The Christian Science Monitor//.

===== Summary =====

This article addresses the rising costs of corn as a consequence of increases in the price of land suitable for growing corn. The article asserts that this increase in prices will be felt by consumers, and also mentions the consequence of government subsidies as the consumers' paying more for the crops than the apparent face value of food products containing corn.

The article claims that corn may be profitable, however, as a consequence of increases in the use of genetically enhanced crops, and the use of the land for subsidized soy crops. The article criticizes the use of patents on these genetically enhanced crops, claiming the way these patents are used reduces agricultural innovation and consumer choice by allowing legal claims to be made against the developers of crops that inadvertently have been wind pollinated and thus contain the patented genes. This is a threat to breeders of both corn and soy crops, that the article's author claims is the combining of monopolization and government policy resulting in increased food cost and reduced variety in food products for consumers. While the article acknowledges that genetically modified crops in developing countries have been successful, it expresses concern about the stifling effect of government-supported monopolies on the free market economy.

The article addresses the similar but opposite situation in the European Union, where government bans on genetically enhanced crops are a similar barrier to innovation and a free market in enhanced crops, but form this barrier by banning the technology rather than subsidizing it. The article concludes with a summary of the inflation of food prices resulting from the government-granted monopolies it criticizes.

===== Analysis =====

This article effectively presents the concerns involved in this issue. It strikes me as rather unusual in that it does not take an oversimplified, black-and-white view of the issue and simply argue a predefined party line viewpoint, but takes a more sophisticated look at the issue and suggests that there may be more ways to see the problem than as a simple dichotomy. I found this level of intellectual engagement on the part of the author in this article to be quite a refreshing change from most news reporting I have read recently. It clearly argues for the significance of food price inflation in the discussion of genetically modified crops, and I think that the article's arguments indicate this matter to be of significant importance to take a position in the forefront of the national debate on food supply and agriculture. The great potential for negative effects on the national interest of the free market economy these governmental policies have also is presented as a significant issue to discuss, which likewise should be at the core of economic and policy debate regarding intellectual property and agricultural subsidization.

The author also provides an excellent summary of the contrast between United States and European Union policies, explaining the flaws of each, and providing an argument that illustrates the potential for other solutions beyond the extremes of the spectrum of this debate exemplified by those two regions.
