====== # 2, Israel-Palestine Conflict: Debate ======

Article: "Labour criticises Peter Hain comments on Middle East conflict". //The Guardian//. 30 January 2014. ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/30/labour-peter-hain-middle-east-israel )

===== Summary =====


This article discusses the exâ€“Middle East cabinet minister Peter Hain's comments on the political situation in Palestine and Israel. He expressed a desire for a single-state political structure encompassing both groups. The article is written from a pro-two-state-solution standpoint, criticizing Mr Hain's comments. Mr Hain's party, Labour, criticized his views on the Israel-Palestine conflict, stating that he "does not speak for Labour on foreign affairs". Labour described supporters of a one-state solution as anti-Semitic "fantasists". One of the issues brought up in the debate is the increasing amount of development and settlement in Palestinian land by Israel.

===== Analysis =====

When Israel was established in 1948, it was established as a Jewish state. This causes no end of conflict between the Jews and the Palestinians, since both parties have a sensible argument for their right to the land: when the balance of power in the region shifted to the Jewish state of Israel, a significant discontentment arose on the part of the Palestinians, who, understandably, desired to be in possession of their land. While there are many compelling arguments why each party should have the disputed land, much of the debate around the issue tends to come down to "You're an antisemite!" "No! You're an Islamophobe!", rather than to meaningful discussion of the issues and attempts at an amicable resolution. A one-state solution would help resolve this problem, because a shared governmental context, not biased towards either party, would encourage both sides to try to reach amicable resolutions to the wide range of grievances and disputes between the two. The primary end consequence of this would be a step-by-step process of dispute resolution, consensus, compromise and collaboration. While the solutions thus achieved would not necessarily be ideal in the views of either party, each party would be glad for the concessions the other side made.
