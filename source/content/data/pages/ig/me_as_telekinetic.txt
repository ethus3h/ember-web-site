Last night (the night connecting 11 Sept. 2014 and 12 Sept. 2014) I had a dream that gave me some information.

I had telekinetic powers. God was a thing that reminded me of the stuffed spider in the oatmeal bucket in john edwards market, except monochrome dark brown. And, a lot bigger (same scale as clouds). He orbited the earth. He was over the united states in the summer. That was wehre i was too. I saw him in the himalayas too in the dream, but i wasn't there (that was when i didn't have any powers isnce he wasn't over america.)

His presence over a place wa needed for powers.

There were many powers given by Him, but usually a person only had one (e.g. mine = telekinesis). It took me a while to learn again (i'd been able to do this a long time ago but thought it was a dream) but a friend tought me telekinesis again refreshing my memory. She wore blue dress with light blue grid marks ~1/2" square from each other.

I could fly using my telekinesis byy levitating myself, as i could levitate other things.

I also dreamed that people with psyschic powers like me & my friend were that way because of being mutants. And because of nanomachines. Both those ideas seem to conflic with the idea of god granted power. And the second seems too be kresnik ripoff.

Most people at this time did not know the existence of these abilities (secret society kindd of thing).

Chi was teh mechanism of the powers.

There was a old lady that we had to convince for some reason that these powers exist.
