[This chapter introduces the characters Merrick and John (and to some extent, Leaf).]

John: 27 years old. Gamer, plays RotMG and LoL. Used to have a big beard. This chapter told from his perspective.

Merrick: Basically the same. Stubbly instead of beardy. Likes cold, wet places, thinks of himself as an undine. Will be 28 yrs old in a week.

John thinks RotMG is better; Merrick things LoL is better. Both are quite heavy.
====== June 2017, hotel in New Hampshire ======

John met a guy in LoL who helped him learn the game a bit. They hit it off in vent and decided to meet up at a hotel in a rural area for some serious gaming. [Music: Fahrenheit's "Autofobia"] John has RotMG and LoL open in his computer, and they are trying to decide what to play. Merrick says, let's just play the better one! John is like, RotMG obviously. Merrick says LoL and John says ok, I don't really know how to play it so that sounds like it would be good to learn.

JOHN: Sure, let's do it. I feel like I haven't **learned** anything... [next panel] ...in a **long time**.

MERRICK: What do you do? Like, for a living?

JOHN: [raises his arms helplessly] I'm a **NEET**. [Merrick: B-| to facepalm] [next panel] What about you?

MERRICK: I maintain the software for the personnel management system for the **Marines**. I know, it may sound boring...

JOHN: No. Dude. I, like, **envy** you. You know, you're doing something, like, **worthwhile** with your life.

MERRICK: I keep telling myself that.

JOHN: I just sit around on my ass and play games off my **inheritance**...

So, they play LoL.

While they were there, John got locked out of his room. He started to get dizzy while trying to find someone to help and to find his way back, and was rather incapacitated. Merrick was asleep in the room at the back of the hotel they had on the floor above ground level. The hotel caught fire, and John passed out. Firefighters carried him out. When he woke up, he remembered Merrick, and panicked. In the meantime, Merrick got woken up by the fire. He stepped off of the bed, and the burnt floor under him collapsed. He landed on the floor below.

John sprayed himself down with water, and jumped through a ground floor window of the hotel to rescue Merrick. He saw him a few rooms down (the walls dividing the rooms had collapsed by this time). He picked up the now-unconscious Merrick, and carried him out. Once they were outside, he passed out too, still holding Merrick's hand. Merrick goes from unconscious to sleeping, and curls up closer to John.

When he woke up, Merrick was in a wheel chair, having been crippled by the fall.

[Show John, surrounded by a blank area — no faces drawn — labeled "HOT BISHIE HAREM", saying things like, "Hey, we aren't crippled..." "I'm **blond**..." etc..]

JOHN: I LOVE MERRICK! I ONLY LOVE MERRICK, FOR ALL ETERNITY!
[next panel, facing the reader] ...No, this is not going to be a harem comedy.

(Note that the burning building rescue thing is ripped off of an episode of Yu Yu Hakusho I watched (yesterday, IIRC). The whole story is based on a dream I had last night (the night separating 20 Sept. 2014 and 21 Sept. 2014). I'm writing this 21 Sept. 2014.) (My comment: corny romance setup anyone? oh well. I'm not a very good writer anyway. Lol.)

====== May 2017 (flashback), New Hampshire ======

John sees a doctor about the worsening bouts of confusion and dizziness. He learns that he has cancer in his spinal fluid (leptomeningeal metastases).

====== 2 September 2018, Virginia ======

Merrick is back with the Marines, working in Virginia, having returned in late August from the apartment in New Hampshire where he was living with John. His prosthetic legs arrive. He is elated to have them.

====== 14 Sept. 2018, New Hampshire ======

John gets a letter in the mail, reminding him of his appointment for a consultation about his previous chemo session. He goes, and speaks with the doctor. As John walks into the oncologist's office, the doctor puts away a letter from the New Hampshire state government's treasury. The doctor looks at his heavy brown book on oncology, and says to John that he is taking him off of chemo. He tells John that he has three months, give or take, to live.

====== 14 December 2018, New Hampshire ======

Merrick is at John's funeral, which is being held in a bleak, snowy field. After the ceremony, a man comes up to him and puts his hand on his shoulder, and says to him:

//...He will always be with you.//

[This is the first appearance of Leaf in the comic. The reader doesn't know yet who this is. Nor does Merrick.]

[Music: Origa's "Inner Universe"]

Merrick runs away from the funeral, into the middle of the field, [show him running from an aerial view] where he collapses under a weeping willow. [show side view of the tree with him under it]

====== December 2018, Virginia ======

Merrick requests John's medical records from the government of New Hampshire, and shows them to his mother, who is an EMT. She takes them to an acquaintance from medical school who is an oncologist. Merrick finds out from the acquaintance that decisions in John's treatment were made using out-of-date knowledge from the 1900s. [This is the brown book the dr. was using — it's the old oncology book I own] He finds out that using modern treatments, the cancer might have been able to be removed. [Music: Dead by April's "Painting Shadows"] He also finds out that even taking into account the outdated knowledge, John should not have been taken off chemo so early. He finds out that the oncologist John was seeing was under pressure from the state government to not prescribe chemo for so many cases, since it was costing a lot of money. Merrick suspects that the oncologist, trying to save money, may have seen John as an ideal case to take away treatment from because he was gay.
