<code> <kyan_> Thanks :)
 <kyan_> So there is a trick to getting the original file
 <kyan_> not a WARC, but the unmodified document
 <kyan_> also to getting some things that are blocked by robots.txt
 <kyan_> I don't know if either of those tricks would help your use case, 
 <jleclanch> yea?
 <kyan_> but anyway, they exist. Or did last I knew of them
 <kyan_> It's best to stay quiet about them, though
 <jleclanch> sure
 <kyan_> I don't remember them right off, but I'll look for them if you're interested
 <jleclanch> always interested
 <kyan_> Ok, just a sec :)
 <kyan_> Ok, one of them is stick "im_" onto the end of the date in the Wayback URL
 <kyan_> https://web.archive.org/web/20000407082332im_/http://www.msnbc.com/modules/tvnews/today/today_left.jpg
 <kyan_> That I think sometimes gets around Robots.txt
 <jleclanch> interesting
 <kyan_> The other one is "id_" at the end of the date
 <kyan_> e.g. http://web.archive.org/web/19991012140308id_/http://google.com/
 <kyan_> returns the original source code
 <kyan_> (without the JavaScript toolbar and such)
 <kyan_> sorry it took me a minute to find them again
 <jleclanch> ok, yeah that helps
 <kyan_> Also: it's fairly hit or miss, but if the server isn't serving the page correctly, then it'll often say "The machine that serves this file is down" blah blah blah, with a link to the WARC
 <kyan_> thing is, those WARCs are mostly darked,
 <kyan_> except for e.g. the ArchiveBot ones
 <kyan_> That's sort of depending on something being broken,though :P
 <jleclanch> mmk
 <kyan_> Anyway, sorry I don't have a real way to get the WARC, though
 <kyan_> but hope those are useful :)
 <jleclanch> they are yeah 
 <jleclanch> thanks
 <kyan_> glad to hear it! :) np :)
