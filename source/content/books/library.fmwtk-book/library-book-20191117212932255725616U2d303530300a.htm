<h2>Ember Library</h2>


<h3>Library Section 1: Basic knowledge, to be included in the text of this specification</h3>
    <p>This section of the library will require research and writing. It should consist of many short sections, each covering a topic. Each of these sections should list all other sections that must be understood as prerequisites for understanding it; the dependency tree of every section should culminate in a single section that gives a basic understanding of the dominant language of the reference (probably English, for the forseeable future), so that by translating that one section into another language, every other concept in the reference can be understood by reading its section and its section's prerequisites.</p>
    <!-- <h4>Library Section 1 Contents</h4>
    <p>See <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/section-1/">[http://futuramerlin.com/section-1/]: the dedicated sub-page</a>.</p> -->

<h3>Library Section 2: Great cultural works, to be included as digital data as part of this specification</h3>
    <!--

    <h4>Using the Web environment</h4>
        <p>This section of the library includes a Web environment as a Vagrant appliance. (For more information on installing and using Vagrant, visit <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/">[https://docs.vagrantup.com/]: the Vagrant Documentation Web site</a> or reference the book <i>Vagrant: Up and Running</i> (Mitchell Hashimoto, 2013). When using the Vagrant appliance, it may be advisable to disconnect the media library’s storage medium before running vagrant destroy, because if you are running Vagrant as a user with write permission to the folder, it may follow the symlink and erase it. This seems to possibly be a bug in Vagrant; this may be related to <a href="https://github.com/MSOpenTech/vagrant-azure/issues/30">[https://github.com/MSOpenTech/vagrant-azure/issues/30]: this issue</a>.</p>
        <p>To start using the Web environment, cd to the “Meta/Web environment” folder. If there is not a Vagrantfile in the folder (there should be), run:</p>
        <pre><code>vagrant init <a href="https://archive.org/download/virtualbox_201501/virtualbox.box">https://archive.org/download/virtualbox_201501/virtualbox.box</a></code></pre>
        <p>and update the Vagrantfile as desired. If there is already a Vagrantfile, continue to the next step: run <code>vagrant up</code>.</p>

<h3>Library Section 3: The data held by the Ember cloud infrastructure</h3>
    <p>This section of the library will presumably be too much information to be included in the Ember specification, although future information storage technology advances may render that less of an issue.</p>
<h3>Ember Library: Contents of section 1</h3>


<h4>Base section</h4>
    <p>This section should have no prerequisites. It should contain a summary of the basics of English in many languages to allow the other sections to be understood.</p>

<h4>Studying</h4>
    <p>It is important to study. To study effectively is challenging.</p>
    <h5>How to Study</h5>

<h4>Mathematics</h4>
<h4>Physical sciences</h4>
<h4>Chemistry</h4>
<h4>History</h4>
    <h5>1900s</h5>
        <p>In 1969, the Apollo 11 carried astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin into space, who then landed on the moon.</p>
