<p><book-omit>The proposal documented in this Web site</book-omit><web-omit>This book</web-omit> represents the vision of hope that I have for the future.</p>

Every person should be able to carry the basic knowledge — management and governance, technology, history, culture — of the world with them, freely given and shared; an Ember of their world, carried as one's constant companion and asset. Thus, each person can be an Ember, able to use that knowledge to ignite a new community without losing the heart of the old, or to fork it to develop their own communities and societies.

Thus, this <book-omit>proposal</book-omit><web-omit>book</web-omit> is an attempt to create this document.
