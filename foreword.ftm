<p><book-omit>The knowledge within this Web site</book-omit><web-omit>This book</web-omit> represents a vision of hope for the future.</p>

Every person should be able to carry the basic knowledge — management and governance, technology, history, culture — of the world with them, freely given and shared; an Ember of their world, carried as one's constant companion and asset. Thus, each person can be an Ember, able to use that knowledge to ignite a new community without losing the heart of the old, or to fork it to develop their own communities and societies.

This <book-omit>Web site</book-omit><web-omit>book</web-omit> is an effort at creating such a document: a first Ember. It is shared under a libre, copyleft license so that it can be shared freely, and if desired, changed to create new Embers.
