"GDPR: data portability is a false promise" (https://medium.com/mydata/gdpr-data-portability-is-a-false-promise-af460d35a629). 2017 July 4, in <em>MyData</em>.: This article discusses how corporations, when charged with preserving individuals' electronic information, cannot be relied upon to make it easy to transfer to other information technology environments; even if the data can be exported, which is rarely available as a lossless option, it cannot necessarily be transferred to other services due to the lack of standardization. At a minimum, lossless information exporting should be available, with documentation of the format in which it is exported. Google Drive, for instance, does not provide any lossless, documented, supported export format. They offer some supported and documented formats, but they are not lossless (particularly significant is the absence of export of document revision history, despite that history being stored and exposed via the user interface). Some success has been reported with retrieving their native format, but it is not documented, supported, or easily accessible (https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/45562; http://features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs/).</li> <li>"National Museum of Brazil fire" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Brazil_fire). In <em>Wikipedia</em>. This tragedy exemplifies how organizational apathy to cultural preservation can cause devastating losses.</li> <li>Browne, Malachy. "YouTube Removes Videos Showing Atrocities in Syria" (https://web.archive.org/web/20171004135730/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/world/middleeast/syria-youtube-videos-isis.html). 2017 Aug. 22, in <em>The New York Times</em>. As corporate-mediated platforms become primary communications media with increasing reliance on them, the effects of using a privately managed platform without the traditional legal protections of press freedom become increasingly pronounced.</li> <li>ArchiveTeam. "A Million Ways to Die on the Web" (https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=A_Million_Ways_to_Die_on_the_Web). This article discusses some of the threats to the preservation of Web-based media.</li> <li>The practice of "wiping" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiping; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes) historic broadcast media (radio and television) shows is illustrative of popular attitudes towards historical preservation: when value is not recognized at a given moment, things are wantonly neglected or destroyed without regard for what value they may hold in the future. Similarly, many films are lost, especially those that were stored using fragile and flammable nitrocellulose film, in the absence of comprehensive systems in place to ensure their preservation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_preservation; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_film; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrocellulose#Film).</li> <li>"Slack's bait and switch", in <em>Opkode</em> (https://opkode.com/blog/slacks-bait-and-switch/), as well as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16567009">this discussion</a> in response to it, and especially <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16569232">this comment</a>; also <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it-391bcc714c81">this article</a>, and <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943">this page</a>, <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115002422943-Message-and-storage-limits-on-the-Free-plan">this page</a>, and <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-guide-to-slack-data-exports">this other page</a> from Slack themselves. The popular Slack messaging app is designed to capture its users' data, without allowing it to be easily exported: a Slack user cannot export (or even view) all the data they have access to. This prevents people from practically preserving their data stored using Slack. Their business model relies on capturing users' data, and holding it hostage until organizations need it enough to pay them for it.</li> <li>Snapchat (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat), like Slack, is a company that predicates its entire business model on the wanton destruction of history: it provides a communications tool that is marketed upon the premise that messages sent with it are forgotten. It is unconscionable that the attitude even exists where anyone would find this acceptable, never mind that it is <em>widespread</em>.</li> <li>The Adobe Illustrator vector drawing program doesn't have a smudge brush, although Adobe Photoshop does. There isn't a technical barrier to this (a smudge brush could be implemented by having a final pass over the rasterized artwork applying the equivalent Photoshop transformation), but because a smudge brush is a raster-centric concept, it is not provided even though it would be useful.</li> </ul> <h2 id="relatedprojectsandinspirations">Related projects and inspirations</h2> <ul> <li>The Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) is working to preserve and provide access to all knowledge.
