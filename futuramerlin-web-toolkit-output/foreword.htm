It is my attempt to reshape society to stop its oppression, harm, waste, and frustration. I don't know when or where you are reading this, but my government uses the funding levied in taxes from my income to fund violence and oppression of the most vulnerable people, instead of supporting them; and it is generally considered one of the more just governments out there. The government under which I live supports the wanton destruction of history and knowledge. It engages in this destruction actively, through the use of laws to prevent the sharing of knowledge — under the euphemistic name of "intellectual property", which is really just encouraging theft by the wealthy from the intellectual commons, an abuse accepted because the society has utterly failed to develop a reasonable strategy for supporting those who create knowledge. The government under which I live also engages in this destruction passively, through the lack of support given to archives and other efforts to preserve history and knowledge. The government under which I live is supporting industries that are actively and permanently damaging the world we live in, such as allowing the use of technologies that produce substances that are causing the world's climate to change, and granting legal protection to insufficiently tested bioengineered organisms. Horrifically, these are decisions made by a government that is at least somewhat, albeit unequally, <em>collectively governed</em> by its citizens: this is not a dictatorship. These problems are not unique to this government, either: some are better; many others are far worse. A dramatic shift in the structure and roles of society and government and in the perspectives of individuals — all of which are intertwined and self-reinforcing — is needed to stop these abuses, and many others. This project is my effort to help. I give you this work as my hope. May you take this Ember in your heart, and may it help you create, and survive, and sparkle! </main> </body> </html>
