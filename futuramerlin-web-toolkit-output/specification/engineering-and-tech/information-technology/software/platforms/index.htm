It is incomplete, but more complete than any other. It is quite slow because most StageL routine calls currently are treated as JavaScript functions declared with async and called with await, which requires creating a new Promise object for every call.</td></tr> <tr><td>Firefox extension</td><td>edit-webextension</td><td>A Firefox extension is available that wraps the Web implementation's edit tool and allows loading text from Web pages into the edit tool, and editing the contents of text pages using the edit tool. As only the edit tool is available, this is not a full EITE implementation for this platform; access to the other elements needs to be provided as well. To install the Firefox extension, add it to Firefox using about:debugging (it will only stay installed while Firefox stays open). To use it, select some text to view (or place the cursor in a text-field to edit), then click the toolbar button. The text will be made available in the pop-up edit tool. To put the edited text back into a text-field, click the Done button in the lower right corner.</td></tr> <tr><td>C</td>(none yet)<td>A bit of work has been done to add C as a StageL transpilation target, which is the first step in porting EITE to a new platform.</td></tr> <tr><td>WebAssembly from C</td><td>(none yet)</td><td>This is an eventual goal of the C implementation to allow it to run faster than JavaScript.</td></tr> </tbody> </table> </main> </body> </html>
