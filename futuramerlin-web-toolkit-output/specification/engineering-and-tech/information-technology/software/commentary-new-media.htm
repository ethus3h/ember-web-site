This section of the proposal evaluates this project's expression of this set of traits.</p> <p>The first of these traits is <em>innovation</em>. This project proposal is arguably merely an extension and refinement of existing systems, and so may not be considered true innovation, depending on perspective. Even in that case, however, because those existing systems are themselves innovative, this project remains a work within new media, even if it is not itself a new medium.</p> <p>The second trait is <em>convergence</em>. This proposal is highly convergent, being a broadly scoped project to innovate across a wide range of technology applications. It is intended to inherit the capabilities of existing computers, which are used for text, sound, image, video, and interactive media, among others.</p> <p>The third defining trait is <em>everyday</em> presence. As a project to develop a unified system providing all necessary technology infrastructure, if it is successfully completed and used to its envisioned potential, it would be able to serve as the framework for people's everyday lives. When only available in partial form, those portions of it can be used in everyday settings as well (<em>e.g.</em> large chunks of my classwork and other data I rely on and use on an everyday basis (personal projects, music library, email, etc.) are stored and managed using software developed in the course of developing this project).</p> <p>The fourth trait is <em>appropriation</em>. This proposed project ideally will be highly appropriative, because so much work has already been done. It would in all probability be hugely wasteful and impractical to attempt to build everything from scratch, rather than to leverage existing systems (even if only practical through inspiration!) and merely work to fill gaps and integrate the various existing technologies well. That said, reliance on proprietary or externally managed technologies should be eliminated as soon as practical, with all elements of the project and its dependencies being fully libre, because proprietary, non-maintainable, and trade-dependent systems are brittle and are a huge threat to the ability of human society to maintain its standards of living over time. Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.</p> <p>The fifth trait is <em>networkedness</em>. As a design goal for this project, networking should be provided when available, but never mandatory. Systems that depend entirely on networking are, echoing the discussion of the fourth point, brittle. A cloud computingâ€“backed virtual digital assistant, for instance, is thoroughly useless in the event of networking being unavailable. Once constructed, the best tools would be fully usable in a vacuum.</p> <p>The sixth trait is being <em>global</em>. The proposed project is intended to be able to be geographically dispersed.</p> <p>The seventh trait is <em>generational</em>. Whether an age gap will affect this project is hard to predict. If it does, it should only be by the choice of individuals, rather than by inaccessibility or prejudice: if people who are a different age than the majority involved in the project, those people should be provided any necessary accommodations to the fullest extent possible (medical care for the elderly, education for the young, and so on). This project should not engage in discrimination based on age, although it could only serve adults until a sufficient child protection framework is in place (<em>e.g.</em> I think Google doesn't allow kids to use it, so this presumably shouldn't either).</p> <p>The eighth trait is <em>inequality</em>. Unfortunately, this likely may affect the project initially, particularly due to economic barriers to access to information technology systems. Working to reduce undesired inequality as much as possible should be a design goal of the project, while promoting diversity and freedom.</p> </main> </body> </html>
