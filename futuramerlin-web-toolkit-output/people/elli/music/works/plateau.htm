It is quite possible that it was however released later; 2 October 2009 is another likely date, as the second artwork panel (the one with the most complex track listings) was last modified 2 October 2009, indicating that an error in the listings may have been fixed then for the release. For simplicity's sake, I will use ~29 September 2009 in the listings here.)): <a href="../works/plateau/sylfan2-flowofspirit.htm">Flow of Spirit</a></li> <li>Release <em>Infinite Universe: Electric Dream Redux</em> (27 May 2015): <a href="../works/plateau/electricdreamredux.htm">Plateau</a></li> <li>Release <em><span style="font-style: italic">Best Works:</span> ﴾ ∂ȃzǣ ﴿ <span style="font-style: italic">through</span> <span style="font-family:anoeyfuturamerlincommedium,AnoeyFuturamerlincom">,itfaen-atél-eselit.</span> | Part 1</em> (2009 (Probable dates: 10 December 2009, 11 December 2009, (less likely) 19 December 2009, (less likely) 30 December 2009.

Possibly the artwork was revised after release on either 11 December 2009 or 19 December 2009. The audio files were last modified 19 December 2009, with the exceptions of tracks 2, 3, 4, and 5, which were last modified 30 December 2010; that is probably due to retagging them or some such thing. Because the most recently edited artwork files for Part 2 were modified 11 December 2009, I conclude that this album was probably released 10 or 11 December 2009.)): <a href="../works/plateau/bestworksitfaenpt1.htm">AQUA12: Plateau</a></li> </ul> </main> </body> </html>
