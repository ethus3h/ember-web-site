So, my conclusion is that it was probably released ~29 September 2009. It is quite possible that it was however released later; 2 October 2009 is another likely date, as the second artwork panel (the one with the most complex track listings) was last modified 2 October 2009, indicating that an error in the listings may have been fixed then for the release. For simplicity's sake, I will use ~29 September 2009 in the listings here.)): <a href="../works/centrecore/sylfan2.htm">Centre Core</a></li> </ul> </main> </body> </html>
