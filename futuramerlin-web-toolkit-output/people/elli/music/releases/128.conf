note,There is at least one major error in the album artwork: the duration for track 7 is incorrect; the duration from TrackListsMbz.txt (which is a fairly reliable source, and contains a more plausible value) was used instead. Note 2019apr13a14: OGG transcodes were made 2019apr13a14 using Sound Converter 3.0.0-beta1.
