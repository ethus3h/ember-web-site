date,2009 (Probable dates: 10 December 2009, 11 December 2009, (less likely) 19 December 2009, (less likely) 30 December 2009. All artwork files were modified 10 December 2009, with the exceptions of the files "cdcover copy.key" and "Backup of cdcover copy.key" (11 December 2009), and the files in the folder "v2" (19 December 2009). Possibly the artwork was revised after release on either 11 December 2009 or 19 December 2009. The audio files were last modified 19 December 2009, with the exceptions of tracks 2, 3, 4, and 5, which were last modified 30 December 2010; that is probably due to retagging them or some such thing. Because the most recently edited artwork files for Part 2 were modified 11 December 2009, I conclude that this album was probably released 10 or 11 December 2009.)

note,Note 2019m04d16: folders.tar.gz is described as "archive of two empty folders that were associated with this release" in the previous discography version. I'm not sure why the release tracks' archive is called relsrc rather than original; perhaps just an oversight. Note 1 September 2013: The track listing in panel 2 of the artwork states that the instrumentation for this track is "Footsteps, Synthesizer, Vocals", but I think that is a mistake. Note 2019m04d16n2: The previous note was for the instance of track 15 ("(Untitled)") of this release in the previous discography version. Note 2019m04d16a17: OGG and MP3 transcodes were made 2019m04d16a17 using Sound Converter 3.0.0-beta1.
