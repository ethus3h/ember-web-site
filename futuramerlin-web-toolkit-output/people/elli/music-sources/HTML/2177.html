&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bibliïsm is a recently-developed religion, the philosophies of which are best-represented by the following text:</p><blockquote style="color: #aaaaaa;
font-family: 'Centaur', 'Cochin', 'Vtimes', 'Times', 'Times New Roman', serif;
font-size: 1.1em;
text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is not a single, conscious entity. God is everything, and everything is God. To interact with God is to form community, to love, to form partnerships. Community lifestyle, and interacting positively with others, are states of connexion with others and with God that help build an healthy world. Once everyone in the word attempts to love and promote peaceful interaction, humanity will have made government obsolete, achieving the ideals of anarchy and spirituality — government, the intention of which is to maintain peace, is made irrelevant when all try to interact peacefully and lovingly. This can never be achieved, but it is an ideal for which everyone should strive. Sin can not be defined by any one list thereof, but is defined by intent: it is any act committed with the intent of hurting, or neglecting to comfort or alleviate suffering — hurting or neglecting God. There are many effective ways to connect with God; however, many acts are committed in the name of God which aid only the part of God most noticed by the person or institution committing them, while harming another. The modern world is filled with destruction, often fueled by the insatiable desire for and obsession with wealth. Wisdom is the state of knowing how to be compassionate, how to love, and how to aid others in their search for wisdom. To act on one's wisdom is aiding God. Godliness and community can be not only with men, but with other animals, plants, and inanimate objects, as well.</blockquote><p style="color: #aaaaaa;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote a sense of community and to gain wisdom, Bibliïsts read nightly after 21.00. Bibliïsts protect and care for books, not damaging or writing in them. Bibliïsts do not eat animal-sourced foods excluding human-sourced foods, eggs, or dairy products.<br>
