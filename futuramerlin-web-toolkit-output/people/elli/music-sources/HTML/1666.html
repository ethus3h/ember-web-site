What can be done: Policy
</h3>
<p>
A method for correcting the issue of factory farming using policy would be to create legislation mandating periodic inspections, performed by OSHA  inspectors. Currently, OSHA inspections, performed by employees, some of whom regularly falsify inspection data, are grossly mismanaged. The advantages of this proposal are that it would protect the workers and their rights, and that lessened line speeds would reduce the stress on the livestock. The disadvantage is that it might not be well-enforced due to the meatpacking industry's vast political power.
