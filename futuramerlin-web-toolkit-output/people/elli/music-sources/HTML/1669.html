What I Advocate
</h3>
<p>
For this project, I will undertake advocation of the last choice. I would initially determine the level of public interest in such a group by using a survey to determine the level of public interest in such a group. Then, I would hold a meeting to determine initial methods of action the group would take and establish a board to control and direct the group. Next, I would attempt to connect and coordinate with similar groups that I would research. The group would then interact with the others to succesfully coordinate the groups.
