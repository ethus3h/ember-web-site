Why these are <strong>important</strong> questions: It seems necessary to continue making this issue obvious and widely discussed, to make it seem less of an issue to be debated and more of an accepted reality, so that corporate interests stop seeming relevant in consideration of these issues. How does the project <strong>address the questions</strong>/issues?: It creates a cultural artifact that contains the ideas to be promoted inherently within it. This is an education project, wherein the objective is "marketing" an idea. "set up one of these eco-friendly board games to encourage teamwork, cooperation, and sustainability lessons" (https://www.treehugger.com/culture/monopoly-with-carbon-credits-7-green-board-games-for-the-new-generation.html) The project addresses <strong>ecological issue</strong> of: Consumer products are made in ways that are not ethical or sustainable, and natural resources are not sufficiently valued and respected. <strong>Superficiality or depth</strong> of response: It is a superficial project, as it is an educational initiative. It does not push engagement directly, as it takes the form of a traditional board game. Use of <strong>design decisions</strong> to support the project intention, and fit the concept: The use of natural materials to form material for marketing environment respect is appropriate, as it removes the hypocrisy inherent in creating such materials as disposable rubbish made of non-renewable materials, like is often the case. <strong>Technology</strong>: The project uses the traditional technology of board game for marketing its core idea. This is perfect for the intent, as it is a simple technology that can be used in an environmentally respectful manner, which is not the case with more complex recent technologies (anything using a meaningfully capable personal computer, for instance, is impossible to make happen without a dependency upon environmentally unethical technology, as there is no known environmentally sound way to obtain such a personal computer at present). This project is a proposal for an eco-friendly board game of monopoly â€” all natural elements that are cut or shaped to be actual pieces. <ul> <li>Different places on the board would represent environment places in the world that should be protected and deserve awareness.</li> <li>The cards would also follow that type of theme.</li> <li>Ideally, the entire game would be made out of rocks and wood.</li> <li>The idea of the project is to also bring an awareness to the importance of the environment and to also give an idea of the financial value that these properties have to us but not only us, but to the environment and everyone who inhabits it.</li> <li>This project embodies both empowering the community to be self-aware and protect the environment, as well as empowering people to take a step forward and do it themselves.</li> </ul> Cost and Labor <ul> <li>the pieces would need to be found outside, they would need to be cut or shaped to the design needed. As for the cost their would be zero cost to the actual materials other than the effort required to find natural materials and adapt them to the game. The only type of cost would be that to the environment. However the idea of this project is to use dead materials or to recycle other materials.</li> </ul> Audience <ul> <li>targeting people who need to be educated on environmental issues and people who are environment friendly</li> <li>people who like to make projects of their own.</li> <li>people who can read and do math</li> <li>people over the age of 10</li> </ul> Financial Gain <ul> <li>This will mean less bought materials for other companies but also less spending for the consumer. The games could be sold pre-made at $10 per game but we will also provide building details for free to anyone who may be interested in making it themselves.</li> </ul> </main> </body> </html>
