There are a few points in it I especially like. One of these is the idea of focusing on retention metrics rather than conversion metrics. The article uses a "funnel" as a metaphor for user conversion and retention, which I think highlights a problem I have with a lot of Web-driven products, namely that they seem to optimize for the first part of the funnel (getting the potential user interested in the product, cultivating brand awareness, etc.) and neglect the other parts of the process (ease of onboarding, and product value / "reason" for retention). This has the consequence that I often am interested in Web services on the basis of the "buzz" surrounding them (in other words, I make it into the top of the funnel), but get tossed aside almost immediately because the services didn't optimize the experience for those later parts of the funnel.</p> <h2 id="How_Google_Improves_User_Experience_with_the_HEART_Framework.22"><strong>"How Google Improves User Experience with the HEART Framework"</strong></h2> <p>This article, following up on the previous one, discusses Google's specific strategy for Web-driven product choices, using a combination of metrics, user testing, and user feedback. I'd like to quarrel with this one, though: while the overall strategy is good, neglecting the principles described in "Metrics Versus Experience" leaves me frustrated. Specifically, the article presents the modal dialog shown in the picture at the right<a href="google-drive-slideout.png"><img class="size-medium alignright" src="google-drive-slideout.png%3Fw=338.png" alt="google-drive-slideout"></a> as "an easy, non-intrusive way to entice users to download and start using the better product experience". While that works in some cases, there are two major problems with it. First, it is obnoxious and reduces the current user experience, even though the user could probably guess there was an app without getting nagged about it. Second, individual apps often don't improve experience: often as not, they're just slow and annoying.</p> <h2 id="Reducing_Cognitive_Overload.22"><strong>"Reducing Cognitive Overload"</strong></h2> <p>This article provides ways to create user experiences that help the user be able to work with complex products. A failing in this zone is what led to the "Discord" Web communication app confusing me when I tried to use it — it simply was too visually cluttered to be practical to use.</p> <h2 id="User_Memory_Design.22"><strong>"User Memory Design"</strong></h2> <p>This article presents strategies for creating memorable user experiences for the user.</p> <h2 id="The_UX_Design_Success_Ladder.22"><strong>"The UX Design Success Ladder"</strong></h2> <p>This article presents a similar philosophy to Donald Norman's of optimizing for both functionality and aesthetic sensibilities, and presents their coexistence as a recipe for a successful product.</p> <footer class="nav-links"> <div class="nav-previous"> <a href="../../../2017/09/05/2-thoughts-on-what-is-design.htm" rel="prev"><span class="meta-nav">&larr; Previous post: </span>Thoughts on &quot;What Is Design?&quot;</a> </div> <div class="nav-next"> <a href="../../../2017/09/20/article-response-reducing-cognitive-overload.htm" rel="next"><span class="meta-nav">Next post: </span>Article response: &quot;Reducing Cognitive Overload&quot;<span class="meta-nav"> &rarr;</span></a> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
