It provides an overview of the user experience design profession, as it applies to Web site UX design. In addition, it provides a directory of resources for those interested in user experience design. It's especially interesting to me how it provides many examples of Web sites that I would rather have be designed differently, from a graphic design perspective, but nevertheless have <em>workflows</em> that I can appreciate (<em>e.g.</em> Amazon): I get the impression that the distinction between the overall workflow and the actual design and content of the work being designed is important to getting user acceptance. In my case, when there's a Web site that I want to use but that bothers me, a lot of the time the problems are either missing features, or things that can be removed using a Web content blocker such as uBlock Origin. From that, I think that the negative response I have to it is largely drawn from elements of the site outside of the actual workflow that the UX design process would have created, and instead is reacting to poor content overlaid onto an effectively designed workflow. The article suggests using A/B testing software, writing that "Split testing determines which version is better based on these statistics". I think that supports that distinction between workflow and content, because the UX that A/B testing would be examining would generally be the workflow, and not the content. Consequently, the content — and the "features" I mentioned earlier — do not really <em>get</em> tested.</p> </main> </body> </html>
