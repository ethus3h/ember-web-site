One case study given in the talk that interested me was that of the successful i-mode cellular service from the 1990s. It shows a feature of the service — drink purchase using the Internet — that Moggridge points out is poorly designed. The problem with the service is that it is very <em>slow</em>, and most customers aren't interested in waiting for it. Moggridge observes that many poor designs are connected to technology. Even so, the capabilities of technology systems are so compelling that users are willing to tolerate some bad design in order to take advantage of the substantial abilities of the technologies.</p> </main> </body> </html>
