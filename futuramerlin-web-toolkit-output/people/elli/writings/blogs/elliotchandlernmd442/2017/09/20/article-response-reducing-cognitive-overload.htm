A failing in this zone is what led to the “Discord” Web communication app confusing me when I tried to use it — it simply was too visually cluttered to be practical to use. There are a number of elements of design that the article suggests contribute to cognitive overload. One of the points that really struck a chord with me is the idea of <em>simplicity</em> not necessarily directly corresponding to the ease of use. The article gives </p><figure class="figure-captioned alignright"><a href="cognitive-overload-image10-large-opt.png"><img class="size-medium" src="cognitive-overload-image10-large-opt.png%3Fw=600.png" alt="cognitive-overload-image10-large-opt"></a><figcaption>Article's example of an excessively simplified design that leads to cognitive overload (<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cognitive-overload-image10-large-opt.png">source</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170920012116/https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cognitive-overload-image10-large-opt.png">IA</a>])</figcaption></figure> the screen shot to the right as an example of a user interface that, despite being simple, clean, and elegant, creates extreme cognitive overload for any user uninitiated into the arcane rites of its use. A reason this specifically resonates with me is my experiences with some similarly confusing computer user interfaces, most significantly apps created for the GNOME 3 desktop environment. For example, the Disks app, <figure class="figure-captioned alignleft"><a href="gnome-disk-utility.png"><img class="size-medium" src="gnome-disk-utility.png%3Fw=600.png" alt="gnome-disk-utility"></a><figcaption><em>Disks</em> from GNOME 3 (<a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/screenshot/gnome-disk-utility.png">source</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170920013346/https://software.opensuse.org/package/screenshot/gnome-disk-utility.png">IA</a>])</figcaption></figure> shown to the left, while being simple, suffers from the same "mystery meat navigation" problem that afflicts the example shown in the article. While it is probably less intimidating to users who are entirely unfamiliar with computers, its tendency to break tradition from traditional computing metaphors makes it truly infuriating to use when one has familiarity with existing software, and the conventional meanings of icons. For instance, while the ⏹️︎ button, which looks like a "Stop" button from a cassette player, is logical in its meaning (it means "unmount"), it is confusing because it doesn't follow the established convention for icons representing "unmount", which is to use ⏏︎︎ (an "eject" symbol), used by the other major GUIs (KDE, macOS, and Windows). One reason for doing this is that when a partition is unmounted, it remains available in the interface, with the button changing to ▶︎︎ (a "play" symbol), but this is not immediately obvious. A better solution would be to use a text label reading "Unmount" and changing to "Mount", rather than a non-obvious icon. (Adding to the problem, the GNOME 3 Human Interface Guidelines <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/design-principles.html.en">suggest</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170920012937/https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/design-principles.html.en">IA</a>) "[using] configuration options sparingly", an approach which has been taken to an unnecessary extreme — if the Guidelines' exhortation to "Use progressive disclosure" were applied, configuration options would not place any significant burden on the software's users.) Compare <figure class="figure-captioned alignright"><a href="zuhzt.jpg"><img class="size-medium" src="zuhzt.jpg%3Fw=600.jpg" alt="ZUhZT"></a><figcaption>Partition management in macOS (<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUhZT.jpg">source</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170920015856/https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZUhZT.jpg">IA</a>])</figcaption></figure> the equivalent tool in an earlier version of macOS, which manages to be readable and fairly obvious in its operation, while being more visually elegant than the GNOME 3 version (although that last is rather subjective). (More recent versions of macOS have brought the interface progressively closer to the painful GNOME 3 version, which is why an older version is shown here.) Similarly, <figure class="figure-captioned alignleft"><a href="747cbc24206f2e42a170377b80b0bc890819d031.png"><img class="size-medium" src="747cbc24206f2e42a170377b80b0bc890819d031.png%3Fw=600.png" alt="747cbc24206f2e42a170377b80b0bc890819d031"></a><figcaption>KDE Partition Manager (<a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/uploads/default/original/2X/7/747cbc24206f2e42a170377b80b0bc890819d031.png">source</a> [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170920020539/https://forum.manjaro.org/uploads/default/original/2X/7/747cbc24206f2e42a170377b80b0bc890819d031.png">IA</a>])</figcaption></figure> the KDE Partition Manager is also quite clear in its operation, although personally I would prefer something between the KDE and macOS strategies. In summary, poorly executed simplification can lead to disorienting user interfaces that lead to cognitive overload for the user.<p></p> </main> </body> </html>
