These are my thoughts on the user experience of signing up for it.</p> <p>The sign up process is presented as a series of steps. The home screen shows a summary of the Web site's purpose, and has some buttons for beginning the sign up process. It is layed out like: <pre>logo          [Get your page] [Log In]

              or sign up with _Google_
               
              [below-the-fold content]</pre> </p> <p>My goal when visiting the Web site was to complete a sign up process. The layout provides four obviously interactive elements: two buttons in the upper right, a button in the center, and a link. The button in the center duplicates the leftmost button in the upper right, although the addition of the word "free" in the button in the center helps reassure visitors who don't want to spend money that they don't have to. I think having the button in both places is helpful, because in the center it is in a prominant location, and it is probably the likely interaction target, either immediately or eventually, of most visitors to the page. (There should, of course, be a sign-up button near the log-in button, because they are conceptually related, and when a user has found a log-in button but does not have an account, they would look near it for a sign-up button. Log-in and sign-up interaction targets are usually found in the upper right corner of Web sites, and it is good to not violate that expectation.) There is one problem on this page, though, which is that the "sign up with Google" link is kind of faint and small, compared to the other visual elements on the page, meaning that people who want that would possibly click on the main button when they actually wanted the link, and then have to click back to get to the link. A better way to communicate this might be either to have two equally prominent buttons. Since "sign up with Google" is what I wanted, I clicked that link to continue. (Because the below-the-fold content was below the fold, and didn't seem necessary for signing up, I didn't read it.)</p> <p>The second step of the sign-up process was a quick and painless, as usual for OpenID transactions.</p> <p>Third, upon returning to about.me, I was prompted to confirm my identity by photograph and name, I suppose to ensure I had not signed in using someone else's Google account. This seems reasonable to me, and was quick and simple to accomplish.</p> <p>Fourth, the Web site requested my name. This went smoothly because it used the name from my Google account, but the Web site falls into the common trap of presenting two separate fields for the name, when one field would allow easy input of a wider range of names (e.g. names with three parts, names with one part, etc.). If the Web site wants to use the separation of names to know a name for informal or formal address, it should simply ask for those forms: a person named "Gregory Chomikuj II" could supply "Greg" as their preferred form of informal address, and "Sir Chomikuj" as their preferred form of formal address. Trying to guess these, while possibly producing correct results <em>most</em> of the time, means that they will be <em>wrong</em> some of the time, frustrating, confusing, or alienating the Web site's users.</p> <p>Fifth, the Web site asked whether the photograph it had retrieved from my Google profile needed to be cropped, and offered the option to select a different one. This was simple and painless; all I had to do was click a button reading "Looks Good!" and it went through fine.</p> <p>Sixth, I was asked for my location. This did not work satisfactorily. While it accepted "Old Town, Maine", it did not accept "Hull's Cove, Maine" (despite accepting Hull's Cove's ZIP Code), and while it accepted "Andhra Pradesh, India" it did not accept "Bobellapadu, India" (despite Bobellapadu being in Andhra Pradesh). Also, the Web site did not offer to use the Web browser's location services to guess a location. If the Web site wants to know where on a map the location given is, a better solution might be to accept the known inputs as it does, but if an unknown input is provided, to ask the user to also specify the latitude and longitude of the location. (User-specified location data should not be offered during other users' sign-up process, though, since it has not been checked for accuracy.) While locations should not be rejected (this is just an unnecessary obstacle for users to work around), the method of indicating acceptance of or rejection of the provided name could be improved as a stop-gap measure while better handling is implemented, by displaying a message when an unknown location is specified. The current implementation simply does not enable the "Next" button until a known location is specified, which could be confusing (it does not clearly communicate what the obstacle is, and how to work around it).</p> <p>Seventh, the Web site asked "What do you love?", and prompted me to "Enter three to five interests". It also provided a palette of example interests from which I could choose, and which I could use as models for what sort of data are intended to go in this field. This is a reasonable design, and went smoothly.</p> <p>Eighth, the Web site asked me for my "occupation or hobby", with a similar palette of choices as for "interests". This also went smoothly, although the Web site does not clearly indicate what those with multiple occupations are intended to do, and the distinction between a "hobby" (in this step) and an "interest" (in the previous step) is somewhat unclear.</p> <p>Ninth, I was asked to choose from a list what my goal was for visitors to the page, with goals such as "Visit my company website" and "Hire me" offered. This was simple and reasonable, although as with the "occupation or hobby", it was unclear whether one will be able to select multiple options from the list.</p> <p>Tenth, I was informed that my email address will not be publically displayed, but that "Messages will be sent" to it. This is fairly good, but could be improved by making it obvious that they mean "Messages from potential employers" when they say that (the only clue to indicate that in the Web site is that the page heading reads "Hire me").</p> <p>Eleventh, I was asked to select a template for the page. There were only three designs offered, which were fairly similar, and two of which interacted poorly with the photograph. It would be nice to either have some more options, or to have an option to adjust what part of the photograph is shown within the designs, (or both).</p> <p>Twelfth, I was asked to select "your color", being shown a picture of the template I selected in the previous step with its dominant color changing to the color I selected. This was nice, although there were only six colors offered out of the 16,777,216 colors that common Web technologies can represent, which seems rather unnecessarily restrictive. Given that the "template" step was rather bland, a better strategy I think would be to remove the previous step, defaulting to the currently default-selected template, and have a seventh choice at this step, being "More options...", which would allow choosing a color using a traditional color-selection widget, and allow choosing a different template.</p> <p>Thirteenth, the Web site presented me with an "upsell" offer, trying to get me to purchase a domain name for between $79 and $91. Because domain names typically expire, this would presumably be a temporary purchase, although that is not specified at all on this page. And getting to the elephant in the room, <em>upsells are obnoxious</em>. They leave the user with a taste of noxious anger in their mouth, and waste the user's time as the user wades through the page eliminating every trace of the spam invasion using their adblocker in a futile attempt at spite. This needs to go, and be replaced with a single, unobtrusive link or button in the settings dialog reading something like "Use a domain name for your page", which would provide the user with instructions for pointing a domain name they already own to the page, and an unobtrusive link or button within <em>that</em> page reading something like "Purchase a domain name for your page". That way, you give your users the option to give their money to you, without obnoxiously harrassing them for it.</p> <p>Fourteenth, the Web site asks what I would like my "link" to be, suggesting "about.me/elliotchandler" (presumably based on the name I had provided â€” I left "Elliot" and "Chandler" as the two parts of the name, which were inherited from Google). This is reasonable, although suggesting "about.me/elliot-chandler" might be better for accessibility (e.g. for screen readers), readability, and search engine optimization.</p> <p>Finally, the Web site presents the finished profile page. This page suffers from two problems. First, in the upper right corner is a button reading "Upgrade", which reeks of being another obnoxious upsell. Second, a pop-up notification appears at the bottom of the page, obscuring the content until it is hidden or closed, rather than closing automatically. Pop-up notifications should only be used with timers that make them go away after a few seconds (to be retrieved if desired from a notification log). That is only part of the problem with that pop-up notification, though: it reads "Ready to add your page to your email signature?". While this seems slightly logical (someone might concievably want to share their profile in their email signature), when one thinks about it for a minute, it becomes obvious that this notification is <em>assuming</em> that one wants to add the profile to one's signature, either now or later, and that it is simply a crass attempt to get the user to spam all their contacts with an advertizement for this Web site, as if the site's designers think that the site's users deserve to be tricked into volunteering as the digital equivalent of people wearing billboards outside stores on behalf of the site, presumably irritating all their contacts through this sullying of their inboxes and thus alienating themselves from the rest of the world in the process.</p> <p>A problem throughout this process is the absence of any way to go back to a previous step in the process, or to cancel the sign-up process and sign out of the Web site (users would often be reluctant to close the window without signing out, as on a public computer, someone else could complete the sign-up process on their behalf). Another problem throughout the process was that there was no way provided to skip questions. A final problem was that there is not an option to view all the questions in a single page, which some users might prefer.</p> <p>In summary, while the Web site generally is quite well designed, it has a few minor user experience failings, and one big one in the form of obnoxiously begging its users for money and trying to trick them into giving them free promotion.</p> </main> </body> </html>
