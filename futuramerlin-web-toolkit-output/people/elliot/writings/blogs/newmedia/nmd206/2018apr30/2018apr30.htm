What was the turning point for when my ideas about New Media changed (if they did)?</strong> — It didn't change all that much, but I suppose it strengthened my understanding of the field's scope. In one of the introductory classes, new media was described as developing our skills in adapting to new media, and emphasizing that the specific media involved are less relevant, giving the example of books having been a new medium when they were first invented. (That seems to conflict with the scope of new media as discussed in this class, but that is irrelevant.) The diverse discussions we had in this class were quite interesting to me, and I typically find that I get more relevant learning and interest out of discussion-driven classes than the specifically guided tasks (e.g. "make a portrait using Adobe Illustrator") (which often depend on proprietary software that I'd rather not have to use). (Some of those specific skill-development classes are useful to me, but not all of the required ones are, which seems somewhat silly. I'd prefer an even more flexible curriculum with more different classes and options, although that might impractically increase the burden on faculty.) <strong>Which kind of New Media work is most interesting for me to view?</strong> — In general, probably hacktivist art or maybe eco art. It is really dependent on the individual work, though. <strong>to make?</strong> — Hacktivism. This makes it easy for me tap into my inner curmudgeon, which makes it a lot easier to find things to talk/rant about. <strong>How did I do with each of my four main projects? Which of the four categories apply to my final project and how/why?</strong> Hacktivist Art — This is a big, ambitious project that I care about a lot. I only discussed some parts of it in the writing for class, but that is to be expected with something of its scope. Autobotography — This is a relatively small project. It came out quite well and is what I implemented for my final project. I care about it from a practical perspective, as it is something I want to use and am missing, but it is not a major driving goal of my life as the project I discussed for hacktivism was. Eco Art — I think I have a good idea for this, but it is less developed in terms of a prototype or practical implementation than the other two. This seems valuable to me, but the process of implementing it is only somewhat interesting to me, and I would probably rather hand this idea off to someone who would enjoy developing it more than I would. Maker Craft — we didn't do this Combinations of any of the above — Any of my three projects could conceivably be regarded through the lens of any other of the three categories, except for the autobotography as eco art (well, I guess it's a tool for sharing music, and the music can be used as a medium for promoting ecologically sound living, so I guess that one works too, although it's a stretch...). <strong>Was I responsible for learning the materials or did I rely on the teacher to provide the content?</strong> — The discussion-driven format of the class provided a lot of opportunities for student-oriented learning and learning from our peers, and gave us many opportunities to challenge and discuss the ideas presented by the professor, which I enjoyed. <strong>Did I do the readings, prepare notes, and contribute ideas or questions from the readings to class, or in my work?</strong> — Yes. Some readings I might have missed? It's hard to tell. It might have been easier to keep track of what was expected if it were given in a simple calendar in a syllabus document (the schedule page is somewhat confusing). <strong>Have I kept good reading notes on my webpage?</strong> — What Web page? On the blog? On some other Web site? I don't know what this is talking about, so probably not. <strong>What was my strongest contribution to class?</strong> — In class discussion and debate! <strong>If I could do this class again, what would I contribute?</strong> — I'm not sure. I might try to get a working prototype for the ecotech project, but that would probably require me to have it partly finished in advance because of the time it takes to implement and test an automated gardener. <strong>Which contributions from my classmates influenced my thinking and how?</strong> — I don't recall which new learning in the class was from my peers, specifically; I might have occasional notes mentioning that specifically from class but it would take a while to read through and find them. <strong>For me, the best things about Joline’s approach/material/readings/assignments/feedback were</strong> — lots of engaging in-class debate and discussion. I love that. (Apparently some people don't, but I guess that's just a difference in preferred learning styles.) <strong>What I wish Joline would do next time to improve the class</strong> — Communicate expectations and schedules more clearly <strong>What didn’t work for me in this class (what would have worked better in this regard)</strong> — Again, precise communication of dates and what's due when <strong>Overall evaluation of my own progress and learning in this class. Take your time to think about this and use examples from your work to explain your reflections.</strong> The class provided an opportunity to develop some ideas that I care about. I value that a lot, as the development of these ideas (specifically the one I discussed in the Hacktivism unit) is what I live for. There is also a lot I have learned from considering and participating in the discussions, which are consistently engaging and fun. </main> </body> </html>
