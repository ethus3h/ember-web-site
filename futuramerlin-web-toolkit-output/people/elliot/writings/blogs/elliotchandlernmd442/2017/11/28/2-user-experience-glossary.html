<h1>User Experience: Glossary</h1>

<dl>
    <dt>A/B testing</dt><dd>Testing user responses to two versions of a design that differ slightly, to choose the better design of the two. Typically uses metrics / eye tracking. Can be used in an iterative process.</dd>
    <dt>accessibility</dt><dd>(abbr. a11y) Ensuring that something (typically software) can be used by all people who want to use it (generally the term is not understood as including language / writing system support or user acceptance).</dd>
    <dt>application</dt><dd>(abbr. app) A unit of software that provides a means for a person to accomplish a set of tasks.</dd>
    <dt>artificial intelligence</dt><dd>(abbr. AI) Artificial intelligence is the field of creating computer systems that can provide services to humans for which a step-by-step logical/mathematical model is not readily evident. Uses data mining and machine learning. Has applications in the development of computer and IoT user interfaces.</dd>
    <dt>branding</dt><dd>Design elements that attempt to create a recognizable identity for a product or service, such as a logo or a distinctive color scheme.</dd>
    <dt>case study</dt><dd>The consideration of a specific use of something. Used as an element in the design process.</dd>
    <dt>dark UX</dt><dd>(also <em>dark patterns</em>)The use of user experience design to influence a user to exhibit behaviors desired by the designer (or the designer's client).</dd>
    <dt>data mining</dt><dd>The use of IT systems to get useful information from large quantities of information.</dd>
    <dt>delight</dt><dd>A typical reaction from a user to some aspects of designs.</dd>
    <dt>design process</dt><dd>The stage of product development in which the design of the product takes place, typically before the product is implemented.</dd>
    <dt>design</dt><dd>Design is the general field of study under which user experience falls.</dd>
    <dt>eye tracking</dt><dd>Data on where a person is looking while using something. Used to refine designs.</dd>
    <dt>flowchart</dt><dd>A diagramming technique that is sometimes used to show a workflow for a design.</dd>
    <dt>graphic design</dt><dd>The field pertaining to the creation of the visual aspects of designs (layout, typography, etc.), such as used in software, Web sites, promotional packaging, and print media. Has some overlap with user experience design.</dd>
    <dt>human-computer interaction</dt><dd>(abbr. HCI) The field pertaining to the ways humans can use computers. Overlaps with design and artificial intelligence.</dd>
    <dt>information technology</dt><dd>(abbr. IT) The field of research into ways electronic equipment can be used to manage information. Used to </dd>
    <dt>internationalization</dt><dd>(abbr. i18n) Ensuring something (typically software) is usable by a range of language users, such as by implementing and testing good support for Unicode / ISO 10646.</dd>
    <dt>Internet of Things</dt><dd>(abbr. IoT) The use of the Internet to allow things that traditionally have exposed non-networked user interfaces to interact with other information technology systems.</dd>
    <dt>localization</dt><dd>(abbr. l10n) The process of making sure something (typically software) is able to behave in the expected manner for users who have a range of expectations for language, date/time formats, etc..</dd>
    <dt>machine learning</dt><dd>The field of developing ways for computers to make accurate generalizations from provided data sets.</dd>
    <dt>metrics</dt><dd>Concrete measurements of how a user interacts with something (typically software or a Web site).</dd>
    <dt>mobile app</dt><dd>Mobile apps are apps that run on mobile platforms.</dd>
    <dt>mobile</dt><dd>Related to handheld electronics (smart phones, PDAs, tablet computers, smart watches, etc.).</dd>
    <dt>mockup</dt><dd>A drawing showing a draft (an unfinished version) of a user interface design.</dd>
    <dt>onboarding</dt><dd>The process in the intended workflow of a design in which a user is introduced to a product.</dd>
    <dt>persona</dt><dd>A set of traits for a fictional person, used as an example of a user during the design process.</dd>
    <dt>platform</dt><dd>An environment in which the development of software takes place.</dd>
    <dt>upsell</dt><dd>A design element that attempts to get the user to spend more money.</dd>
    <dt>user acceptance testing</dt><dd>(abbr. UAT) The process of testing something to ensure that something is actually capable of fulfilling its intended use.</dd>
    <dt>user experience design</dt><dd>User experience design is the process of creating a user experience, often within the restraints created by having specific goals for what the thing being designed should be able to do. Software/Web design is one major application of user experience design.</dd>
    <dt>user experience</dt><dd>(abbr. UX) User experience is the field of study pertaining to the usability, functionality, and enjoyment of something.</dd>
    <dt>user interface design</dt><dd>The process of designing user interfaces, typically of software or Web sites. Encompasses user experience design and graphic design.</dd>
