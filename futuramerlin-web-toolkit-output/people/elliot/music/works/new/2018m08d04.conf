note,This revision of this work changes the fast octave scales in the first bar to single notes, to make it more playable, and changes some beaming and time signatures. I think that the date of 'New in Dorico 2018 August 3 730p.pdf' is probably wrong (chat logs indicate it was from 2018m08d04). The other file created during the course of this session ('NEW exported 2018aug04.pdf' and 'Screenshot_2018.08.04_16.52.22.png') are merely file format conversions of an older revision of this work.
