====== Indexing a directory's contents by filename for fast searching ======

Run the following command (where /PathToIndex is the directory you want to index): 

  updatedb -v -l 0 -o /PathToIndex/.locate.db -U /PathToIndex

If you do not want to see what it is indexing while it works, instead, run (where /PathToIndex is the directory you want to index): 

  updatedb -l 0 -o /PathToIndex/.locate.db -U /PathToIndex

To search the database, run (where /PathToIndex is the directory you want to search and SearchTerm is what you're looking for):

  locate -d /PathToIndex/.locate.db SearchTerm

To update the index, run the command again that you initially ran to create the index (it doesn't matter whether or not it's the command format that shows what it's indexing).
