=====Split a large FLAC or APE audio file and a cue sheet into multiple tracks=====
Split a large FLAC or APE audio file and a cue sheet into multiple tracks: 
  split2flac file.flac -cue file.cue
or
  split2flac file.ape -cue file.cue
If it asks for an encoding: if the file's in Russian, the correct encoding is probably cp1251.
