**Futuramerlin.com Unicode** was a pan-Unicode typeface family created ~2010. Originally taken from the [[Plane3]] typeface (the only (IIRC) completed part of a project to create a pan-Unicode typeface that became the Futuramerlin.com Unicode project and later the [[Wreathe Unicode]] typeface), corresponding to plane 2 of the Unicode standard. It consisted of [[FuturamerlincomUnicode2]], [[FuturamerlincomUnicode3]], [[FuturamerlincomUnicode15]], and [[FuturamerlincomUnicode16]], corresponding to planes 1, 2, 14, and 15, respectively.
