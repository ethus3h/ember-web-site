Person (Metaphor) commits suicide. Imagines hell. “Wakes up”, as if from a dream, to imagine the Underworld (à la Ereshkigal). “Wakes up” again, in a perfectly white/empty “space”.

Metaphor thinks to self: Was I dreaming? How could I be dreaming? I'm dead.

In the whiteness, words appear (The Storyteller): No, you are not dead. (no speech bubble)

Metaphor: But I shot myself. I should be dead. What am I?

The Storyteller: You are a metaphor, a parable given life by my storytelling.

The Storyteller is shown at a desk, drawing Metaphor.

Metaphor: Did I decide to shoot myself, or did you decide for me?

The Storyteller: You decide.

Metaphor: Do I exist?

The Storyteller: You decide.

Metaphor: What I am experiencing now, is it real?

The Storyteller: You decide.
