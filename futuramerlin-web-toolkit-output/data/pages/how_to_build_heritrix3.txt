See some threads in mailing list here:

Make sure you have the JDK and maven2 installed.

Download the source code from Github: https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3

Run <code>mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true</code> in the heritrix3-master directory, unless you want to build the tests in which case run <code>mvn package</code> instead.
