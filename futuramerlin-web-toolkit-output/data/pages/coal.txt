The Coal Project is an experimental knowledge archival system built using the Internet Archive’s services. The project stores knowledge in a consistent way that enables the information to be understandable by both computers and humans, and accessible to historians, analysts, and other researchers. It is distinct from projects such as Wikidata and MusicBrainz that aim to collect knowledge, in that a primary purpose of the Coal Project is to archive this information. It is also distinct from projects such as the Internet Archive that primarily archive unstructured documents, in that the Coal Project archives knowledge in a way that can be understood by computers. The Coal Project can supplement archived documents by making the knowledge they contain available separately from the documents themselves, as well as by placing documents within the historical context in which they were created by making connections between the documents and other archived records.

**Coal** is the storage system for [[Ember]].

In a nutshell: Long number in, short number out… then later, can put the short number in and get the long number out
