**Fracture%%//%%Active** is a in development web service for providing data storage, manipulation, and web UI construction to authorised clients. Provides access to the [[DCE utilities]]. Renamed from [[Futuramerlin Active Scripting Library]] 3 October 2013.

It should use a database to maintain a list of API keys (not really, since it's not an API, but you get the idea). Those keys could be assigned unique numbers by the Token Registry.

====== Components ======

  * FractureTokenRegistry
    * Accepts: request for a key and paired value [required even for simply assigning unique identifiers, so as to enable some amount of reverse lookup], OR a retrieval request, specified by key
    * Does: Adds a key to the key registry, making sure to prevent conflicts/race conditions, OR reads a key's accompanying data from the registry
    * Returns: A new key, OR the retrieved data
  * FractureFMDR
    * Accepts: a submission of data (see [[Futuramerlin Document Registry]] for information on specifics of database fields), OR a retrieval request, specified by ID
    * Does: Adds a record to the Document Registry, making sure to prevent conflicts/race conditions, OR reads an ID's accompanying data from the registry
    * Returns: A new ID, OR the requested data
  * FractureStorage
    * Accepts: data (optionally with authorization code) OR request for data, accompanied by key OR request for removal of data, providing a key and an authorization code for authentication OR request for updating data, providing a key, data, and an authorization code for authentication
    * Does: store data, using FractureTokenRegistry to get unique identifier OR read data OR remove data (accompanied by removal code) OR replace data accompanying key with new data
    * Returns: identifier OR data OR confirmation OR confirmation
  * FractureDceutils
    * Provide wrapper around necessary [[dceutils]] functions, including converting to/from base64 Dc list, converting a sequence of key/value pairs of arbitrary base64 Dc lists to a DCE document, and extracting data from a DCE document given a key.
  * FractureDB
    * object-oriented wrapper for some common database operations around PDO
  * SpecialPurposeUtilities
    * removed from roadmap


===== External modules =====
These provide support for external software, including [[RACE THE °MUSIC]] and [[ARCMAJ3]].

  * External modules — include by passing a parameter ?module=ModuleName
    * **RaceTheMusic**
      * RTMHighScores_Compute
        * Accepts: A list of user scores
        * Does: Compare with previous [[RACE THE °MUSIC]] high score list and update the high score list using FractureStorage
        * Returns: New high score list
      * RTMHighScores_Retrieve
        * Accepts: A request
        * Does: Retrieve current [[RACE THE °MUSIC]] high score list
        * Returns: High score list
    * **arcmaj3**
      * ArcM_Request_Bucket
      * ArcM_Submit_Bucket
