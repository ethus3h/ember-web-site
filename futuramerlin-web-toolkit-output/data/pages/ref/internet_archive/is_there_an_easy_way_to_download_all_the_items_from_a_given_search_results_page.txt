 <kyan> hi! i'm wondering, is there an easy way to download all the items from a given search results page? (I'm using the new UI.) Thanks! :)
 <SketchCow> No.
 <kyan> Dang. Ok, thanks :)
 <kyan> Ok, i figured out a workaound for anyone who's wondering. 1st select the search results table (in list view). 
 <kyan> then copy it to the clipboard. Don't get select all because that'll get the toolbars and user pages and stuff.
 <kyan> 3rd, paste it into a rich text editor (e.g. Libreoffice, Bean, etc.) Save it as RTF (rich text format). 
 <kyan> Then open that RTF file in a plain text editor. Replace every occurance of /details/ with /compress/. Copy that results as plain text to the clipboad.
 <kyan> Paste it into a URL extractor (I used http://pgl.yoyo.org/urlex/ ). set the extracto to output HTML tags to the browser.
 <kyan> (Have to use Firefox for this.) Then use DownThemAll on that tab. Use the Quick Filter field to select only URLs containing compress. THen, make sure the count of selected urls is equal to the count of search results.
 <kyan> Then, set a folder for the downloads, and start the downloads. Voila!
 <kyan> Hope that helpss someone out :)
