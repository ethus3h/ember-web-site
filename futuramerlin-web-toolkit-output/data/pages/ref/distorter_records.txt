**distorter records** is a record label. Their label page was apparently at [[http://www.last.fm/label/distorter+records]] (saved in Wayback Machine in case it is taken down: https://web.archive.org/web/20140126193106/http://www.last.fm/label/distorter+records ) but has been deleted. Google-search turns up [[:ref:taped noise|taped noise]]'s website http://www.tapednoise.com/ when searching for distorter records, and given the similarity in the logos I would speculate that perhaps that is a new incarnation of the same label. distorter records's name & logo are still shown on last.fm page: http://www.last.fm/music/1/Untitled+Album (saved in Wayback Machine in case it is taken down: https://web.archive.org/web/20140126192554/http://www.last.fm/music/1/Untitled+Album ).

====== Observation 29 January 2014 ======

http://distorterrecords.com/ redirects to http://www.tapednoise.com/. I think that pretty much settles it that taped noise is a newer incarnation of the same label.
