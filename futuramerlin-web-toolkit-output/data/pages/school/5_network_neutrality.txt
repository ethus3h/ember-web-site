====== HON170 article summary and analysis: # 5: Network neutrality ======

===== Summary =====

Article: Cecelia Kang. "Court strikes down FCC ‘net neutrality’ rule". 14 January 2014. //Washington Post//. (http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/court-creates-new-game-for-web-access-in-america/2014/01/14/539c9a2a-7d3e-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html)


This article discusses a range of concerns regarding the use of corporate funds to finance increased Internet service speeds for individual Internet content provider companies. In January 2014, a federal court invalidated previous government attempts to encourage competition in the World Wide Web. The disadvantage of such a change, as with any monopolization of an industry is the reduction of choice between content providers for consumers. Another concern is the possible restrictions this could place on political speech, for example if politically biased news sources are sponsored, and thus become more accessible via the World Wide Web. The article mentions several responses to the change from a variety of influential individuals in the Web industry, mostly expressing dismay at the implications of the changes. The ruling concluded that because the Internet is considered as a service rather than a utility, the Federal Communications Commission is not in a position to regulate it. The article describes this as a "technicality". The article also mentions concerns on the part of consumer rights groups that the FCC's position will not be upheld by its new chairman, Tom Wheeler. Some Internet access providers have created arrangements by which companies can sponsor access to specific Web sites for free, while charging for access to others. The ruling, according to the article, is mostly disliked by the political left, but supported by the right.

===== Analysis =====

This article accurately addresses a number of the concerns involved in the thorny issue of network neutrality. Nevertheless, it fails to address a few key economic points. I also read another article from //Forbes// (Mark Rogowsky, "Netflix Decides The Free Market Isn't So Good After All, Wants Government To Step In". //Forbes//, 21 March 2014. (http://www.forbes.com/sites/markrogowsky/2014/03/21/netflix-decides-the-free-market-isnt-so-good-after-all-wants-government-to-step-in/print/)). These two articles together might present a more complete and accurate picture of the issue than either individually does. The //Forbes// article presents compellingly some of the various arguments in opposition to network neutrality, many of them not addressed thoroughly in the //Washington Post// article. For example, one of its major points is that proposals for network neutrality would place undue financial burdens on Internet service providers, by compelling them to finance the rapidly increasing amounts of bandwidth demanded by Internet content providers. However, I think there is a fundamental flaw in the //Forbes// article in that it doesn't particularly consider the role of the customer in the question. When it brings up the concern that increased bandwidth usage on the part of Internet content providers will present a burden to the Internet service providers, it only considers that the cost could be borne by the service provider or the content provider, when (as is the traditional model) it would make the most sense for the cost to be borne by the individual customers based on the connection speed and bandwidth usage they want. The article also suggests that Internet content providers without significant financial resources could work with content delivery networks to achieve connectivity speeds matching those of more wealthy companies. This argument especially seems like a point that the //Washington Post// article neglects to address.
