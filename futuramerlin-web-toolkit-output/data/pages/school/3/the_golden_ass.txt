====== #3. Blank Laughter: The role of the crowd in /The Golden Ass/ ======


Apuleius' //The Golden Ass// is a strange, philosophical, surreal, and on occasion rather disturbing allegory. It tells the tale of Lucius, a man who aspired to become a bird through magic, failed, and became an ass instead, ultimately returning to human form and finding a sort of redemption through the goddess Isis. Throughout the book, there is a conceptual division of tone between the relatable main character and the insane world he lives in, seeming to exist solely to get a soulless laugh out of others' suffering.

This is most directly seen in book 4, "The Festival of Laughter". At the beginning of that book, he was arrested for murder. "Two constables were ordered to arrest me and, though I offered no resistance, I was dragged violently off. When we reached the end of the lane I was astonished to see an enormous crowd waiting for my appearance: the entire population of Hypata seemed to present." â€¦ "as I glanced up for a moment at the roaring crowd lining the roadside, I could not see a single person among all those many thousands who was not bursting with laughter."
