For [[HON170]].

Article: "Of negotiations and high treason: Israel-Palestine 'peace'", an editorial in Aljazeera by Susan Abulhawa, 12.06 16 January 2014 (http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/01/negotiations-high-treason-israel-palestine-peace-201411273239332824.html) Initially drafted in an IM, 26 January 2014.

====== Paragraph 1, Summary ======

The author of this article is criticizing the agreement between Israel and Palestine currently in development, asserting that it establishes peace between the parties at the expense of land loss to Palestine. A campaign called "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions" (BDS) to  promote human rights has been pressuring Israel to come to a consensus with Palestine in the face of the growing power of BDS. The author criticizes historic violence on the part of Israel, asserting that Israel's end objective now is not only preventing expansion of BDS but also getting Palestine to relinquish their cultural value placed upon the land of Historic Palestine. There is a current power imbalance between Israel and Palestine, to the advantage of Israel, and so Israel wants to pressure Palestine into accepting an agreement structured and determined to Israel's advantage before public support for Palestine gives it the power to negotiate fairly with Israel. Israel's proposed land agreement will have significant long-term negative implications for Palestine's land rights and resources, reflecting the long-term concessions proposed by the previous Oslo Accords.

====== Paragraph 2, Assessment/Analysis ======
This article is an editorial, and thus must be read with a grain of salt. The author's clear pro-Palestinian bias makes me wonder what the other side of the argument is. In this article, though, she uses effective rhetoric and presents logical arguments to call for increased fairness for Palestine in negotiations with Israel. While Palestine may have valid claims to the land rights it would relinquish under the proposed agreements, perhaps Israel has equally persuasive land rights arguments to lead it to its desire to retain those land rights for itself.
