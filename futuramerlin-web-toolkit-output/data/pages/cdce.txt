**CDCE** means **Coded [[DCE]]**.

It is a way of easily representing [[DCE]] content using [[FMNP]]-style [[@-codes]].

The @-codes for CDCE are the same as the numeric [[DCE]] ids for each character, rather than HTML-aliasâ€“style named representations.

I haven't defined any values yet.

For some thoughts about what I'm going to do with this see [[CDCE ideas]].

Any code can be converted into HTML display text. The function [[c]] will handle this, taking one CDCE-formatted argument and replacing it with the HTML output. The comment in the code reads:
		#Parse a supplied CDCE string and return it as HTML
It will do that using the database to provide an [[intf]]-style table of DCE codes and HTML replacements in Unicode.  A single DCE code does not need to map to a single Unicode character, because that would defeat the entire purpose of it.


CDCE is Unicode text with the @-codes embedded in it as desired.

The character @ obviously may need to be expressed using DCE itself to avoid syntactical confusion. It probably always should be.

===== Example=====

This is an invalid @27@DCE-form@21@tted string@560237@
