**Wreathe 2** was a cancelled version of [[Wreathe]].

* Release group: [[autumnfairy]]

* Branch: [[Wreathe 2* (branch)|Wreathe 2*]]

It was to have been based on [[Wreathe 2 dev / Wreathe 2a]]. I wonder, if Wreathe 2 had not been cancelled, based on the wallpaper of [[Wreathe 2 Extended Edition / Wreathe 2e]] and my recollections, whether the release group would not have been codenamed 'Mist'â€¦??
