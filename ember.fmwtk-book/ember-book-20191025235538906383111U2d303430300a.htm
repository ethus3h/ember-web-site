<h2>Foreword</h2>


<p>This book represents a vision of hope for the future.</p>

<p>Every person should be able to carry the basic knowledge — management and governance, technology, history, culture — of the world with them, freely given and shared; an Ember of their world, carried as one's constant companion and asset. Thus, each person can be an Ember, able to use that knowledge to ignite a new community without losing the heart of the old, or to fork it to develop their own communities and societies.</p>

<p>This book is an effort at creating such a document: a first Ember, holding knowledge of the past and present, and principles and dreams to help create a better future. It is shared under a libre, copyleft license so that it can be shared freely, and if desired, changed to create new Embers.</p>

<p>This is my life's work: to collect and develop this knowledge, these hopes and ideals and visions, and give them to others. It is my attempt to reshape society to stop its oppression, harm, waste, and frustration. I don't know when or where you are reading this, but my government uses the funding levied in taxes from my income to fund violence and oppression of the most vulnerable people, instead of supporting them; and it is generally considered one of the more just governments out there. The government under which I live supports the wanton destruction of history and knowledge. It engages in this destruction actively, through the use of laws to prevent the sharing of knowledge — under the euphemistic name of "intellectual property", which is really just encouraging theft by the wealthy from the intellectual commons, an abuse accepted because the society has utterly failed to develop a reasonable strategy for supporting those who create knowledge. The government under which I live also engages in this destruction passively, through the lack of support given to archives and other efforts to preserve history and knowledge. The government under which I live is supporting industries that are actively and permanently damaging the world we live in, such as allowing the use of technologies that produce substances that are causing the world's climate to change, and granting legal protection to insufficiently tested bioengineered organisms. Horrifically, these are decisions made by a government that is at least somewhat, albeit unequally, <em>collectively governed</em> by its citizens: this is not a dictatorship. These problems are not unique to this government, either: some are better; many others are far worse. A dramatic shift in the structure and roles of society and government and in the perspectives of individuals — all of which are intertwined and self-reinforcing — is needed to stop these abuses, and many others. This project is my effort to help.</p>

<p>I give you this work as my hope.</p>

<p>May you take this Ember in your heart, and may it help you create, and survive, and sparkle!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>"Ember" is the current working name for a project to develop and facilitate collaboration on the principles and knowledge to build stronger communities, and give individuals greater ability to shape the society around them by sharing this knowledge. In the way the free software movement has allowed individuals to shape the computing systems they use, individuals or small communities should have the tools and knowledge to shape the rest of the infrastructure and society around them. Any person should be able to carry the basic knowledge of the society and technology available to them with them at all times in a durable, reliable, accessible format such as writing on paper, and carry a large library of additional cultural knowledge with them in a durable form accessible given the knowledge of the basic information; and each community should have a reliable copy of all knowledge.</p>

<h3>General approach</h3>

<p>This project should aim to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living, and to ensure the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. The communities should attempt to provide a consistent and complete experience to the people who are part of them, without depending on support from external infrastructure, technology, or government. Relying on external support increases fragility.</p>

<p>This is a multifaceted project to develop a scalable environment for building an effective, just, and efficient society; consequently, it is quite broad in scope. The project has four primary areas of focus:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A specification, encompassing:
    <ul>
        <li>The principles on which the project is based</li>
        <li>The collective management and governance of communities</li>
        <li>The engineering and technology systems to provide a community with a comfortable, sustainable, and dependable lifestyle</li>
        <li>A library of knowledge and great cultural works</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>A community managed in the manner defined by the specification</li>
    <li>Implementations of the knowledge assets (such as software) defined by the specification</li>
    <li>A supporting non-profit organization to manage the project</li>
</ul>
