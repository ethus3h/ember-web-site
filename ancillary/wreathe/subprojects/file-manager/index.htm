<h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>This project is to provide a file manager app for Wreathe, as currently available options are not sufficient.</p>
    <p>There are three avenues for attempting to implement this. One, used so far, is maintaining ebuild for Dolphin 4.7. This is impractical due to the increasing requirement of older version of libraries (poppler,dbusmenu). Second, attempt to implement miller columns in current Dolphin. This is a lot of work, although I have started on it somewhat in branch <code>wreathe/implement-miller-columns-on-current</code>. Ultimately, it would be the best strategy. Third, attempt to port Dolphin 4.7 to KF5. This is also difficult, although I have started on it somewhat in branch <code>wreathe/kf5-port</code>. Back to maintaining the old ebuild it is.</p>
    <p>Version 4.11 uses Nepomuk 2.</p>

<code>macro_bool_to_01(Nepomuk_FOUND HAVE_NEPOMUK)</code> becomes
<code>
if(Nepomuk_FOUND)
    set(HAVE_NEPOMUK 1)
else()
    set(HAVE_NEPOMUK 0)
endif()
</code>
