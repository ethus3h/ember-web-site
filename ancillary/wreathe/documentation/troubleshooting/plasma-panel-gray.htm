<h2>Problem</h2>

    <p>Plasma panel sometimes appears grey instead of transparent, even when Compiz is running</p>

<h2>Solution (workaround)</h2>

    <p>Clicking on the panel (or on grey bits of it?) fixes either some or all of the grey part(s). Click more than once as needed. It can be a little hard to click right on the grey parts when the grey part is small (e. g. when it's around the quicklaunch icons, IIRC); just try to hit it again.</p>
